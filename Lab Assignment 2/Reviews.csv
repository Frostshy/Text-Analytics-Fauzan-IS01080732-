2,1,product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanutsthe peanuts were actually small sized unsalted not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as jumbo
3,4,this is a confection that has been around a few centuries  it is a light pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts  in this case filberts and it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar  and it is a tiny mouthful of heaven  not too chewy and very flavorful  i highly recommend this yummy treat  if you are familiar with the story of cs lewis the lion the witch and the wardrobe  this is the treat that seduces edmund into selling out his brother and sisters to the witch

29,5,i got this for my mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake  shes the one with the sweet tooth  they both loved these toffees you would never guess that theyre sugarfree and its so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free  i was so impressed that ive ordered some for myself w dark chocolate to take to the office so ill eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweetsbr these are just excellent
30,5,i dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind  we picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away  when we realized that we simply couldnt find it anywhere in our city we were bummedbr br now because of the magic of the internet we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of itbr br if you love hot saucei mean really love hot sauce but dont want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat grab a bottle of tequila picante gourmet de inclan  just realize that once you taste it you will never want to use any other saucebr br thank you for the personal incredible service
31,5,i have never been a huge coffee fan however my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the latte macciato no coffee shop has a better one and i like most of the other products too as a usually noncoffee drinkerbr the little dolche guesto machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good coffeelattecappuccinoetc in less than a minute if water is heated up i would recommend the dolce gusto to anyone too good for the price and iam getting one myself 
32,5,this offer is a great price and a great taste thanks amazon for selling this productbr br staral
33,4,mccanns instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it there is no escaping the fact however that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation  still the mccanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal its even better than the organic allnatural brands i have tried  all the varieties in the mccanns variety pack taste good  it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issuebr br mccanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product  real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff one thing i do not like though is mccanns use of thickeners  oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum but this is a convenience product  maybe the guar gum is why after sitting in the bowl a while the instant mccanns becomes too thick and gluey
34,4,this is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand  it uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup so not only does it have a better sweetness but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you  great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make mccanns steel cut oats  the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too  plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart
35,5,instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl mccanns instant oatmeal holds its texture has excellent flavor and is good for you all at the same time mccanns regular oat meal is excellent too but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning this is the best instant brand ive ever eaten and a very close second to the noninstant varietybr br mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples  cinnamon and maple  brown sugar count boxes pack of 
36,4,mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples  cinnamon and maple  brown sugar count boxes pack of br br im a fan of the mccanns steelcut oats so i thought id give the instant variety a try i found it to be a hardy meal not too sweet and great for folks like me postbariatric surgery who need food that is palatable easily digestible with fiber but wont make you bloat
37,5,for those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store  i love mccanns instant oatmeal  all flavorsbr br thanksbr abby
38,5,what else do you need to know oatmeal instant make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisinsnuke for  seconds more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something its still just oatmeal mmm convenient
39,4,i was visiting my friend nate the other morning for coffee  he came out of his storage room with  a packet of mccanns instant irish oatmeal  he suggested that i try it for my own use in my stash  sometimes nate dose not give you a chance to say no  so i ended up trying the apple and cinn  found it to be very tastefull when made with water or powdered milk  it goes good with oj and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the worldor the day at least  jerry reith
40,5,i ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter  she has this almost every morning and likes all flavors  shes happy im happybr a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeoqwmccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples  cinnamon and maple  brown sugar count boxes pack of a
41,5,the variety packs taste greatbr br i have them every morning at  cents per meal i dont understand why everyone on earth isnt buying this stuff upbr br maple and brown sugar is terrific followed by apples and cinnamon followed by regular you dont get tired of the same ole thing and they taste greatbr br i just boil water from a small pot empty the packet or  in a bowl pour in boiling water and watch it expand to x its sizebr br taste really good and takes minutes to preparebr br not sure why everyone on earth isnt this convenient healthy very quick excellent quality and extremely cheap
42,5,mccanns makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour to the sloth addled instant which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes its all good thats for sure and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regularbr   this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccanns and other wellknown oatmeals what i personally like about mccanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples  cinnamon though tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to usebr   the only bad thing  if you can consider it a bad thing  about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes this is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters but if youre a single person alone  well love oatmeal
43,5,i have mccanns oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost  per boxbr it is a great product tastes great and very healthy
44,5,mccanns oatmeal is a good quality choice  our favorite is the apples and cinnamon but we find that none of these are overly sugary  for a good hot breakfast in  minutes this is excellent
45,5,we really like the mccanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too oftenbr this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenientbr anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing
46,3,this seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either  it didnt pass muster with my kids so i probably wont buy it again
47,5,good oatmeal  i like the apple cinnamon the best  though i wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste  that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of
48,3,the flavors are good  however i do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand  they are both mushy
49,4,i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular is fine with brown sugar added the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok this is a very quick easy and satisfying breakfast and ill order this brand again but not the variety ill get all maple and brown sugar
50,3,this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores  there is nothing healthy about it  it is just carbs and sugars  save your money and get something that at least has some taste
51,1,this oatmeal is not good its mushy soft i dont like it quaker oats is the way to go
52,5,got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix i bought from the seller and the advertising workedlol  i tried them and shared them with  buddies and we all loved them  so im here to buy more and noticed there were no reviews yet  well now there is  they are hot  but not burn your mouth forever hot  its a nice temp  perfect for us
53,4,this wasnt in stock the last time i looked i had to go to the vermont country store in weston to find it along with a jaw harp cranberry horseradish sauce fartless black bean salsa apple cider jelly newtons cradle art in motion and the staple vermont maple syrupbr br back to the ass kickin peanuts they are hot they will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms it requires a beverage as advertised a glass of very cold milk and a box of kleenex since it will make your nose run they look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work i suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence especially my colleague greg im going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary planters peanuts can and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when i returnbr br the can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed it is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyesbr br youll go nuts over these asskickin peanutsbr br ps im not sharing the peanuts not deliberately and ill probably give greg the jaw harp for christmas hell be so insulted
54,3,were used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy  doubt very much habanero is used at all  could take it up a notch or two
55,4,i roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper but i do it outside of course these beans coffee bean direct green mexican altura seem to be wellsuited for this method the first and second cracks are distinct and ive roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time the aroma is strong and persistent the taste is smooth velvety yet lively
56,5,we roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill about  of the bag at a time  the smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too  more importantly the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste  on numerous occasions weve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much
57,5,deal was awesome  arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters  i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local stores candy
58,5,it is chocolate what can i say  great variety of everything our family loves  with a family of six it goes fast here  perfect variety  kit kat reeses take five and more
59,5,great product nice combination of chocolates and perfect size  the bags had plenty and they were shipped promptly  the kids in the neighborhood liked our candies
60,5,halloween is over but i sent a bag to my daughters class for her share the chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many
61,3,watch your prices with this  while the assortment was good and i did get this on a gold box purchase the price for this wasbr  less at target
62,5,this bag of candy online is pretty expensive it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores other than that its a good combination of my favorite candy
63,1,arrived in  days and were so stale i could not eat any of the  bags
64,5,i have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form  long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder not overly tasty but quite effective as i never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides  same for desert racing in the buggy the camelbaks were always laced with the powder  now we have the fizzwhat a great product  firstly its hammers endurolyte product so its great endurance athletes the world over use their products second its convenient handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz  third it tastes great imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango  the camelbaks always get the fizz now  i also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever i exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes i cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough
65,5,this product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ridebr i have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no aftertaste and i actually like the slight carbonationbr i use other hammer products and really like their whole product line
66,5,this stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides pop  into each water bottle and youre set flavor is fine and goes down easy
67,5,for those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thingbr br two years ago i started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat  i was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue  gatorade wasnt an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so i looked around for a lowcarb alternative  the zero carb sports drinks didnt help so what to do  one day i ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of themvoilaproblem solvedbr br ive shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using thesebr br these guys got it right  they are superbly formulated and simply work
68,2,i purchased the mango flavor and to me it doesnt take like mango at all  there is no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice  ive been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades so im familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products ive tried  the mango flavor is one of the least appealing ive tasted  its not terrible but its bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take
69,3,if youre impulsive like me then  is ok dont get me wrong the quality of these babies is very good and i have no complaints but in retrospect the price is a little ridiculous esp when you add on the shipping
70,5,this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained  pds my fault
71,5,these albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality the bears even have little faces at my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bears rings snakes balls worms whatever are about lb these twin packs of  or  pound bags is a screaming deal as far as im concerned im probably  pounds deep in these friggin things consumed
72,5,grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area in fact pretty much anyone i talk to about grape gummy bears they think im lying so i bought lbs   these bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick but nothing to strong i love grape flavored candysoda and these are pretty good there is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion but these are well worth it for the price i like to use the gummy bears in home made popsicles with flavored sports drink the salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles and the gummy bears are awesome frozen they are delicious
73,5,i ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from fantasicakes website for a dinner party i was hosting it arrived fresh and intact very good size i froze half for later use i am a pastry lover and these were the best ive ever tasted the pastry was soft the jam was really good and the taste was great they were gone in no time my guests were really impressed
74,1,buyer beware please this sweetener is not for everybody  maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body  you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea  headaches can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell  i thought id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping  as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case youre like me  its not you its the maltitol
75,2,it is okay  i would not go out of my way to buy it again
76,1,no tea flavor at all just whole brunch of artifial flavors it is not returnable i wasted  bucks
77,5,these looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix  unfortunately they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate  i left them in my pantry for a few days and when i opened them at room temperature they were still gooey  i through them in the fridge and ive been breaking off hunks ever since  they taste good to me but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again  i wont order them online again but if i see them in a store i would pick them up
78,5,these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last
79,3,the taste was great but the berries had melted  may order again in winter if you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor
80,5,i know i cannot make tea this good  granted i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet  it tastes crisp
81,5,this peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat  my dad got me one for christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when i was a little girl  im  now and i love it
82,4,great gift for all ages i purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much they kept them and would not eat them
83,5,i know the product title says molecular gastronomy but dont let that scare you off  i have been looking for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth  i use it to make my own coffee creamerbr br i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet  but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat and honestly i hate to use manufactured food items  i really dont think they are good for the body  on the other hand i hate using cold milk or cream because i like hot coffeebr br i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer  i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water  which is not a problem for hot coffee  you will have to play with the ratios  i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own i like mixing  of each togetherbr br for flavoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar  i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers  if you wanted you could use a fake sweetner powder instead  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom  let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughbr br this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolateorange mixbr br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online  take the time to experiment  maybe you dont use any lowfat milk or dont add any flavorings  it is up to you  also would make great housewarminghostess giftsbr br i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking  but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great
84,3,while my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food for some reason their itching increased when i tried the lamb and rice i have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help the duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again i like natural balance for the quality ingredients
85,3,awesome dog food however when given to my boston who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night scratching as soon as i changed to a different formula the scratching stopped so glad natural balance has other choices i guess you have to try each until you find whats best for your pet
86,5,we have three dogs and all of them love this food  we bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him no more hot spots or tummy problemsbr i love that it ships right to our door with free shipping
87,5,my dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food she was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has after we got the test back we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand so i finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this she still has her environmental triggers but i am happy she can finally eat something i know wont cause her pain
88,5,my shepherdcollie mix has ibs  our vet recommended a limited ingredient food  this has really helped her symptoms and she likes it  i will always buy it from amazonits  cheaper and free shipping
89,5,natural balance dry dog food lamb meal and brown rice recipe did wonders for my jack russell she has awful food allergys and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didnt have something in it that she was allergic to she has no problem eating it dry but normally i mix the natural balance dry lamb and brown rice with the natural balance wet lamb and brown rice she seems to like that better we started feeding it to our other dog a bichon too and she loves it if your dog has allergys or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it you will see a difference in your pet
90,5,great food i love the idea of one food for all ages  breeds ãžts a real convenience as well as a really good product  my  dogs eat less have almost no gas their poop is regular and a perfect consistency what else can a mom ask for
91,5,i have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food i have switched them to a different food due to price a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance
92,5,this is great dog food my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him
93,5,this food is great  all ages dogs  i have a  year old and a puppy  they are both so soft and hardly ever get sick  the food is good especially when you have amazon prime shipping  
94,5,my golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs ive ever met  after experimenting with various types of food i have found she loves natural balance  what i really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties  i mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it  furthermore i do like mixing up the flavors each time as i think the same meal day over day might get a little boring so i figured why not  i tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smellsbr br additionally i started purchasing off amazon because petco didnt have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans  i came home and to my surprise realized that i could save  each time i bought dog food if i just buy it off amazonbr br all in all i definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food  while i have never eaten it my dog seems to love it
95,5,this is the same food we get at pet store but its delivered to my door and for the same price or slightly less
96,5,ive been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i havent had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for largersmaller sized dogs
97,5,my  year old basenjijack russell mix loves this dog food hes been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year despite the higher cost of natural dog foods i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full on the normal dog foods hed eat up to  cups of dog food a day the recommended serving for his size whereas he only eats about  cup to  cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account youre actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you dont have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier happier dog to boot add in the fact that you can get free day shipping with amazon prime im sold
98,5,our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods the cheap you can buy it anywhere food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets  this food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the foodbr this message is ramsey frankenstein approved
99,5,my english bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age   the vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him iams lamb and rice and onto a new kind  this was the second one we tried and it has been working ever since  its for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food like chicken or beef
100,1,i fed this to my golden retriever and he hated it  he wouldnt eat it and when he did it gave him terrible diarrhea  we will not be buying this again  its also super expensive
101,5,the mouth says how do i love thee let me count the waysbr if you like apple products a must have item  the only draw back shipping cost  these are very heavy
102,4,arrived slightly thawed my parents wouldnt accept it however the company was very helpful and issued a full refund
103,4,the crust on these tarts are perfect  my husband loves these but im not so crazy about them  they are just too sourtart for my taste  ill eat the crust and hubby takes my filling  my kids think theyre great so maybe its just me
104,5,these are absolutely scrumptuous  my husband and i both love them however as another customer put it they are expensive to ship  the cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are
105,5,what a nice alternative to an apple pie love the fact there was no slicing and dicing easy to prepare i also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed
106,5,i like creme brulee i loved that these were so easy just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil they look amazing and taste great my guess thought i really went out of the way for them when really it took all of  minutes i will be ordering more
107,3,not what i was expecting in terms of the companys reputation for excellent home delivery products
108,5,i first bought pickled asparagus at an amish market and it was love at first bite hence when i saw these on the discount rack at the local safeway i cleaned it out  these are even better than the ones from the amish market they are fantastic and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom im going to order the six pack and im a household of one they wont go to waste
109,5,i love asparagus  up until very recently i had never had pickled asparagus  oh my goodness when a friend introduced me to this exact brand i couldnt believe how great stuff tasted  i loved it so much i bought the six pack  ive got  jars left  gonna need more
110,5,im presently on a diet and i was at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocery looking over possible diet foods i wanted things that were tasty nonfat and low in calories i came home with about a dozen items thats how i discovered the tillen farms pickled crispy asparagus well ive always liked asparagus anyway and ive enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus this tillen farms brand is really really good its the best i can recall theres an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which im looking forward to eating i cant believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only  calories per jar now this is my idea of a good diet foodbr br gary peterson
111,2,i was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix  i usually like most of the low carb things i have tried but was diappointed in this specific one
112,5,i have been drinking this tea for a long time now  i used to have to purchase it at a doctors office because it wasnt available elsewhere  im so glad that i can buy it now from amazoncom  i drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee  wonderful taste
113,5,i have been drinking royal king  natural organic green tea  tea bags x g each as my every day tea for several years now  i buy  boxes at a time to save on shipping  for many years i used to drink coffee from morning till night  but finally i realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me  i finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together  i tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit  i found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits  green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier coffe and other drinks do not  the only healthier drink is quality cold water  in my opinion for the price royal king  natural organic green tea is one of the best tasting teas  this green tea has a beautiful golden color the taste is bright and fresh  i recommend adding a tiny amount of ys organic bee farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too  i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea tribute xi hu long jing but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although i would if i could afford itbr br cons  on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped  the one shipped displays naturally high in polyphenol catechins a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea whereas the amazon package displays caffene free  so i am not sure if this green tea is caffene free or not  the other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when i unwrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to unstick it
114,5,this has to be one of the best teas i have ever tasted its clean bright freshbr br great deliveryagain quality just try it
115,5,i love love this green tea  it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually dont get as many boxes as i did with this merchant  i will definitely order from this seller again thanks  i depend on my green tea fix everyday
116,5,i love this tea it helps curb my eating during the day my mom and i have given it all friends to try
117,5,im italian and i lived in italy for years i used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso i couldnt find them anywhere here in the bay area so its great to have them again
118,5,in the s i spent several summers in italy this biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack they are simple and delicious and were not sold in the us back then they are so good that i brought back two bags from a recent trip to italy it is great to see that they may now be found on amazonbr br note it is great to open a bag smell the contents pour a glass of milk then dip the macines in the milk great routine and treat for kids
119,5,i had heard a little about this product from the local pet store then tried a small bag for our  cats of about  and  years respectively the female younger one took to it right away and the older male who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it and would usually refuse a diet change actually liked it too the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request but he totally refused it he is a posh cat after all he still consumes too many calories the fatty but at least i know hes eating good food of course i know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market but i just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there marketed as being healthy why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal is that right ill stay with this for now but stay tunedbr br im updating this review after  months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgraded the stars from  to  as it really has been a good food for the two of them garfield still eats a little too much but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much lets face it our female cat will be  years old in a couple months and shes so healthy shes tiny but happy and agile i tried the chicken version of holistic select but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it
120,5,i started buying this after i noticed my  year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat foodnot the garbage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choices and im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past  months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft mainly he loved the taste even more i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals
121,5,i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat and this is an excellent food  that is also according to my holistic veterinarian  they put probiotics on the kibble as the last step which is very important to me  the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select
122,5,this cat food was recommended by my vet because my  year old cleo cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight  it stopped her problems  she doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price  it aids in digestion since theok sorrysmells are gone if ya know what i mean  had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food
123,5,i have a  year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections  i feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and uri ease  the combination seems to keeps his utis under control  if i switch to another type of dry food his uti gets worse  the other cats seem to enjoy this food as well  its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me
124,5,before i was educated about feline nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two  year old cats and two  year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by proctergamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store holistic select was the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters
125,5,my holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i dont want to be rude so ill say this as delicately as i can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious  i highly recommend holistic select
126,5,one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef this formula is one of the few she can eat and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet both of my kitties are very active have soft shiny fur and neither are fat dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth also
127,5,our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food  they definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great  they are fit and not over weight  this vendor ships extremely fast  is one of the top amazon suppliers in our book
128,4,ive been a fan of hot  spicy maruchan ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice and love ramen youll love this product too bad its way too expensive here on amazon its only  per  at my walmart
129,5,ive been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid and ive never found a better flavor than hot  spicy chicken  it isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me but it sure is good
130,3,i love spicy ramen but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like  hours not sure if that is healthy or not  and you can buy this at walmart for  way cheaper than amazon
131,5,always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in
132,2,i must be a bit of a wuss because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste typically i like spicy food if it has a good flavor  i dont find this to be the case with this soup any flavor is killed off by the burn
133,5,i really loved the spicy flavor these had  i found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite  if you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough
134,5,got these on sale for roughly  cents per cup which is half the price of my local grocery stores plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale
135,5,i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
136,4,i love this flavor of ramen i dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon isnt bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store
137,5,the best investment ive ever made for ginger its unbelievable its fibrous like the real ginger has that spicy kick to it but its perfect with the sugar  calms it down  its very worth the  for lbs of it  ill be getting more soon  i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies 
138,5,delicious i cannot get australian ginger where i live this compares favorably to australian ginger ive purchased in other cities now i can enjoy it without traveling
139,5,i keep trying other brands cheaper brands stupid me this ginger is soooo worth the money tender moist and never a let down
140,5,my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the  other things we have tried what a surprise he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day  of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it
141,4,i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on  because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping
142,4,twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brandbr if you can get these for  to  a package with free sh its a good dealbr the black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
143,5,i love thesevery tasty  infact i think i am addicted to thembr buying them in packs of  bags  is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag  savings are about a  a bag  i use subscribe and save on these and several other product  i love subscribe and save
144,5,if you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children then be sure to try these  theyre soft easy to chew and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car in the summer at the beach etc we love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack great item great price too highly recommend
145,3,i might be mistaken but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size  if they did do that it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal having so many pieces after all  the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience  as it is you have to use  or  pieces to match the old piece size  it is not the same
146,5,being a fan of newmans pineapple salsa for quite a while i was looking for a comparable salsa  this is one of the best tasting salsas ive ever had  my daughters love it too  they dont like super chunky salsa and the berry mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces  the salsa is not too sweet just sweet enough and although its mild it has a nice little kick to it  at this price its a steal
147,2,the salsa smelled delicious as i think it probably was  but unfortunately the person at amazon that is a packer there is probably several had very little stuffing to work with especially on the bottoms  therefore the bottoms were broken on all three bottles as i reached for my computer i was told no returns cause its a food item  i then looked for a customer service tag and i found none on their new face lift  they seem to be proud of their new face lift butthey should at least have a place to contact them in emergencies  like i buy a lot of stuff and it all comes in styrofoam boxes  never would i ship thingsbr especially salsa  in a cardboard box with just a stripe of large bubble wrap on it  no matter how much the carrier fed ex is careful its going to break somewhere along the line  especially in an all glass container  barbara l s
148,5,this is one of the best salsas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it are not worth your money
149,3,these remind me of dog treats i made once using pumpkin and cinnamon theyre kind of bland and not my favorite back to nature product but my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from
150,5,this is the best cornmeal i made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding also fried some oysters with this meal it gave them a great texture and flovor
151,5,this is a fabulous marinade  i love to use it for chicken either baked in the oven or on the grill  this has enough flavor  flair ive even used it for dinner parties only to receive rave reviews from my guests definitely worth the price super cheap and super easy love it
152,5,works with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and makes it taste excellent plus buying in bulk is more than  off from box stores
153,4,got this for my brother who is on jorge cruise diet and decided to try one for myself  it actually tastes pretty good
154,1,these singles sell for    at the store for  box of  singles im not sure why amazon is selling it for  for a box of  singles  hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite but truly this is not a good buy
155,5,awesome such a yummy flavor i got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and i am so glad that i did there are so many things you can do with jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you i will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful
156,5,i went to  grocery stores looking for this flavor of jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here this jello is wonderful evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the fall i couldnt find it anywhere in town this jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe i made with it takes like watermelon jam great made as regular jello too yummy
157,5,what a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use  this box should last our family the year no problem  iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will
158,5,perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket  we love it shakes well no clumping and flows freely
159,5,span classtiny length  minsbr br spanthe expiration date is  months from the day i bought this product the tuna tomato combination is delicious this is one of the many items i reorder on amazon every month or sobr edit added a short video so you see what this combination looks likebr br i was wearing one of those headlamps but i didnt do a good job focusing on the tunabr i should film it over but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway
160,5,ive never heard of the safcol brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches starkist and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning
161,5,these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion  make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato
162,3,i have always purchased starkist tuna but thought i would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tuna was not pleasant too much basil and other spices for me
163,4,im not familiar with the safcol brand but being a tuna addict gave this a shot the tuna tastes like its good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch i was hoping for its still a great option for a low calorie low fat meal
164,5,i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality and no need to dress it upbr br i put it the micro on about  power for  minute and shazambr br i believe a little heating brings out the flavor
165,1,seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at  calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor
166,5,i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it i havent made anything with it yet just eaten a little bit at a time but wow is it decadent its dark syrupy sour and a little sweet a dab of this and i forget about dessert its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone yum im going to try making fesenjan next 
167,5,used this in moroccan recipes as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water  wonderful wonderful stuff
168,1,i dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere but they were so old that they wouldnt cook  i had to throw half of them out because the skins were damaged a clear sign of dried beans past their prime  i cant even return these or ask for a refund because food is not returnable  will find a different brand to use  for now i have about fifty servings of beans to throw away
169,1,besides being smaller than runts they look the same and have the same consistency  unfortunately they taste nothing like banana runtsnor do they even taste good  yucky stuff  trying to return with vendor
170,3,the item over all was fine but the banana heads are not just like banana runts they are alot smaller also when i received the item the packaging was not great the banana heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope
171,5,i purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with jungle theme they worked out perfect for  small bags of candy i purchased  if you want more than  small bags i would purchase a larger bag
172,5,i have drunk ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine i love this stuff in milkbr its much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk i am french and live in the usbr and bring back boxes of ricore at every opportunity savora is another hidden gem you can bringbr back check it out
173,5,i first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in brittany france and thought it was delicious  i wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that i love this product
174,5,i couldnt wait to try the  cinnamon coffee cake because it is made with fresh eggs creamy sour cream madagascar bourbon vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel this  cinnamon coffee cake is available online for only  now i have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes but let me just tell you that the fantasicakes cinnamon coffee cake really takes the cake with size price quality and tastebr the cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition it also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top before serving i couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of  for us to enjoy during breakfast for three days the cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling the flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake the icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and youve got the perfect breakfast treat
175,4,i used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about  years ago this stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going it feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong the stronger it is the less you use as well the product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost i thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad this is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like
176,5,one of the best lemon juice that i have tried i am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product when the season for fresh lemos is out this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshmentsbr br i will continue buying it
177,5,this lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround it has a powerful flavor and you dont need much of it to zest up a dish i add a spritz of it to my water nearly every daybr br i will buy this product again and again
178,5,fast delivery and good product this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and its really handy to have around to add to sauces dressings etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with
179,4,this is not as good as the frozen lemon juice but it is good it has a slightly odd flavor perhaps from a preservative sure wish i could order the frozen juice
180,4,couldnt believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was seriously drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime if you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommendedbr br i feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation after a short time my eyes start to get droopy and i am in another placebr br love this stuff
181,4,i bought these at grocery outlet here in the seattle tacoma are for  a case of tweleve not paying  yes  for a dollar i like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price
182,5,this is an great product the taste is great and it works exactly as described superb natural sleep aid amazing
183,3,we have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule yes wed probably be better served taking a yoga class but this is a good second choice this helps you fall asleep and stay asleep i drank half the first night and that was plenty for me after about  minutes i was ready for bed i woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover so that is a huge bonusbr br i gave the product  stars instead of the  it deserves as their packing job was marginal at best the product arrived with  broken bottles which at this price is a  loss the bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail but the product is awesome
184,5,we made chocolate chip cookies with brm garbanzo bean flour and the results were fantastic  the brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned  our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic cccs  the texture body and elasticity meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours is nice and chewy  the same as cccs made with regular flour  and an added bonus  the high protein and fiber level i calculate  g fibercookie fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lowerbr br i highly recommend this flour even if cccs are the only thing you make with it
185,5,this  is great stuff  made some really tasty banana bread  good quality and lowest price in town
186,5,we had trouble finding this locally  delivery was fast no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores
187,5,this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts i am about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakebr br i use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straightsided forms you can also make minitarts in a muffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and i happen to think these taste bestbr br if you get into baking this glaze is a musthave on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base
188,5,my scotties were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone the smell is kinda strong but not bad its tolerablel
189,4,i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants  i didnt expect it to taste good but it actually does  ive only had it for a few days and for  its totally worth it  my sisters all take ganocafe but now im introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee  i will follow up on this product in a few weeks  
190,3,the coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright  nescafe and mount hagen are better  i bought this to try something other than these two but i probably wont get this again  there is just a slight vitaminy taste but its not overwhelming  its also a bit pricey for what you get
191,5,this coffee is great because its all organic ingredients  no pesticides to worry about plus it tastes good and you have the healing effects for ganoderma
192,5,like the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste ive tried different instant coffees before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is africafe pure instant coffee
193,5,tastes great and gives me energy without the jitters love this productbr however i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packaging
194,5,these little guys are tasty and refreshingbr br i usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath  i eat  of these after lunch because they are so small and i find this sufficiently resolves the problembr br theyre sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which is great and theyre tasty enough that i almost think of them as part of my lunchbr br this is a good bulk value buy and id highly recommend the mints themselves  cheers
195,4,i like these better than the regular altoids but theyre even more costly so youd better like them
196,5,these little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealthere perfict for on the gofifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongand there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarthe price of twelve dollars was very resonablealso there great for shareingif you are looking for a mint try these onesyoull be glad you did
197,5,prosbr packaging shipping pricebr sold about a year before its expiration date enough for me to eatshare  boxesbr not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form its a real mintbr br cons none
198,3,be careful not to eat too many of them in one day as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a laxative lololol
199,5,these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse
200,5,this is a huge supply of them im still working on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or  every time you want a mint
201,2,even with small containers they dont fill them up  these little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares  or how about the cereal ploy they were filled at the factory but settled in transportbr can manufacturers be honest in their dealings
202,5,i love and use the empty containers for medicineadvil in my purse desk suitcase also line with felt to keep earrings perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and love the mints tiny and powerful without burning my mouth
203,5,received as shown my mother in law likes these and walgreens quit carrying them it was great i could get them on amazon
204,4,i keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet when i find someone who keeps coming back for more i just give them their own tin one coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes like i said theyre a real hit since i wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch i gave the item  stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although i totally get why they wrap it  it still doesnt make it easy to deal with
205,5,the tiny altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability its full but compactbr br i havent run out yet and probably wont for a couple months but i cant wait to buy it again
206,5,i loved these wintergreen altoid smalls so much i had to come write a review the packaging is small for convenience and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape blue hue and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regularsize altoids and will continue purchasing them highly recommended
207,5,fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them
208,5,hard to find the wintergreen smalls sugar free as stores only have the red smalls peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country if someone cuts me off i turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen me she pulls one out puts it in my hand and all is right with the world
209,1,to me these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints they are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin and thats as far as it goes the mintiness is just not strong and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis im not a dragonbreath person but still one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will freshen my breath for a short while  maybe  minutes at this point i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints
210,5,we have fed our cats a lot of stuff these  boy cats are not picky eaters they loved the purina they loved the nutro they loved the iams they love whatever we feed thembr br this review is based on what we their affectionate owners love after a certain age we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods because the catties were fatties we tried a few types of food some evinced no change some made the litter superstink  some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow itbr br this felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the kibble is sized appropriate to chewing and heres the kickerbr after feeding the cats felidae their demeanor improved their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food were now loyal felidae consumersbr br additionally the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies
211,5,i started my cat on felidae platinum about  weeks ago and she loves it shes an older cat somewhat overweight and had a grouchy temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which  she ate the felidae and left the old food shes now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy purchaser of felidae i dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it clearly mine does
212,5,we have three cats the youngest is about eleven years old another is fifteen and our oldest is well ancient  that is what the vet told us ten years ago  the youngest is a blob  when he lays down he looks like a footstool the other two are arthritic and skinnybr br since we had such success with canidae platinum for senior dogs i figured that wed give it a try for our cats  id had them on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no ut problemsbr br buster the youngest is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats  however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae  even prissy the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on purina one all she wanted to do was to sleepbr br i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems itll be more effectivebr br however the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life
213,2,too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats couldnt keep it in or down what a mess weve moved on
214,1,as with canidae felidae has also changed their formula  cats do not like change when it comes to their food  and they just had to change it without putting it on their label  we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell  as you will notice i have also reviewd the canidae and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issuesbr br prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home  if cats get upset because of a change in enviorment or a loud noise they can stop eating  it depends on the cat  two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight  we took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal  it has been a year since then and they are better  then the formula for this food changedbr br we started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us  we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food  it wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick  right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs havebr br cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating  anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it  we have  rescued and fixed cats none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulabr br i urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal  as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it  this is just horrible
215,4,dont buy just a few of these  i order these by the case  i cant even remember the first time i tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite
216,5,i order these olives a lot they are unlike any other olives out there the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses one of my favorite appetizer treats for guests
217,1,hey the description says  grams  that is roughly  ounces at under  per can no way  that is the approximate price for a  gram can
218,3,my husband and i are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us it definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it it was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but i dont think i would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormicks brand of fajita mix ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix isbr br if you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchbr br i gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil  cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for  minutes in the meantime it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i dont think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oilbr br i have one more package of this to use and next time im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more
219,5,a friend whod been drinking tea for  of his  years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at lb in a retail store or a little over  with shipping from an online merchant i think its great ive been drinking earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast lapsang souchong assam etc most of them were over lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything im looking for in a strong fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob youll love it
220,5,i love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another ie iced vs hot this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg
221,5,i drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it has a pleasant aromabr br the price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store  one reviewer is right i think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma  so the label imperial blend kind of implied the herbbr br i am not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea is a surprise and affordable too  i usually prefer white chinese tea like white peony but it is more expensive and requires lower temperature water  but this is black tea and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea
222,5,ive tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand but they are just easier to come across  the imperial blend i believe is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones ive tried its full body like a good cup of assam which by no means overpower the delightful clean taste of darjeerling complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy daybr br for those interested in the specifics i use about  teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a  oz mug let it steep in f water for  min take the infuser out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication
223,5,i have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea and the ahmad imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced  i buy the threepacks as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too try one box of it and you will love it too
224,5,this is an excellent tea  one of the best i have ever had  it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar
225,2,herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste it is only for people who like herbal taste i dont
226,4,makes a tasty super easy meal fast but high in caloriesbr br the instructions say to saute the veggies first but i recommend cooking the chicken first the chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess i made it with snow peas and carrots only i dont like the little corn  added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice  it came out wonderful dinner on the table in less than mins
227,5,i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other  most have too much sugar or worst corn syrup  this mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty it does have a little kick enjoy
228,5,might be a little spicy for some but this stuff rocks i use  and with v for a milder version  or the best is a bloody caesarbr half mix half clamato
229,5,took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste  but now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
230,1,this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as describedbr looks and tastes like its way past its expiration datebr would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
231,5,i started drinking the power slim tea when i was on the hcg diet to help curb cravings since i liked it so well i tried some of the others and i am now hooked  they are so satisfying that i drink them all the time  the energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day no matter how long
232,5,im trying several of the wu yi teas i like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also has a natural sweetnessbr br the ingredients include organic wuli cliff oolong tea  mg organic black tea  mg organic green tea extract  mg proprietary blend  mg plus some ginseng panax orange peel lemon grass and guarana other ingredients natual orange and citrus flavorsbr br my goal is to drink more tea and less coffee i am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day ill be coming back to this one
233,5,i cannot live without this citron falksalt it is wonderful on watermelon fish almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does  just try it on red juicy watermelon wonderful experience
234,1,terrible artificial lemon taste like pledge lemon furniture polish dont do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest
235,5,these things are huge i love the way the crystals crunch and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle this lemony flavor is my favoriteits good on almost everything youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this
236,2,the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker  which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese tastebr br what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about  smaller all around  leaving you with about  or so small flatbreadsbr br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at allbr br would i buy these again no  i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame tarragon give you a littlebr more bang for your buck and have more flavor
237,5,this is the ultimate puppy food  the kibbles are great for small breeds  high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use  less waste results from the high quality ingredients  i have been hunting training showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly  years with multiple national champions  i have been highly satisfied with eukanubas quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods  my recent purchases are with wag through amazoncom  their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock
238,4,the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homebr br let me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our laps but you know theyre dogsbr br when we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a  lb bag for the price of i think a  lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cant blame the food itself for gluttonybr br eventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until  year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around  mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better
239,5,a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertastebr br in the  years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of  is superb much cheaper than i can find locallybr br this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend
240,5,fresha great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories they taste just like chocolate pudding
241,5,if you like the ceylon tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this teabr br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon and very surprised at the negative review from  because in the  years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br the current deal for the pack of  is very good cheaper than i can find locallybr br highly recommendedbr br note this listings description is confusing each packet of tea weighs  grams which equals  pounds or  ounces
242,5,ive been enjoying this tea for years  this tea is good mornings afternoons or evenings  my local store went out of buisinessthanks amazon  i use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot
243,5,hi i have to have black tea everyday i have done it in the past  years and its a habit of mine ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and i highly recommend it if you like black tea i think this is going to remain my favorite for the next  years or so 
244,4,i have tried it out despite the other review and i found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either russian or italian groceries
245,4,ahmad tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea great flavor with no lingering aftertaste
246,2,ive been drinking this tea for the past  or  years usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas where many middleeastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at  for a pound box  ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixesbr this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless  somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse
247,5,i love love love this deal  its way fun to pick from so many teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees the other outfits that assemble samplers are boring  they do the choosing and from a much narrower range the sellers here are very nice also and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method its easy if you want great packaging forget it  they ship fast and the kups are just tossed loose in a box who cares
248,5,once youve tried some random sampler packs and now are overloaded with decafsextra bolds or teas this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want  received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what i ordered  this was my second order and ill be ordering this item again
249,5,good products and fast shipping equals a happy me a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavorsa few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
250,5,if used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack
251,5,wow  this product is very impressive i bought the oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging price and shipping  the powder dissolves instantly  even in water  ive just been mixing a  tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away  i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well  im excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon
252,3,the pork chops from omaha steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem
253,1,five minutes in one tentacle was bitten off ball inside cracked in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappointed  so is the dog 
254,4,i am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree i have been using this product for over a year i use it maybe once a week at the most i drink  the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how i feel imo this doesnt replace my am coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when i start to fade once in a while i drink a full bottle before a workout ive been drinking guayaki yerba mate teas for years compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there i highly recommend this this product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body try it before you judge from a review  everyones body reacts differently
255,1,i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about  minutes i paid  for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money
256,2,yes its probably healthier than hour energy or starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload this is still not for you most energy drinks cannot be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of  guayaki shot is  ml  probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands bc they contain too much caffeine andor sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w  full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects  irritability nervousness moodswings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safebr br now youre not sensitive to caffeine then its a great buy its not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant its not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about  to  hours takes about  to  minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your bodyweightbr br side note  if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy
257,5,these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect although i wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar it was excellent i loved the roasted almond roasted pecan and the peanut butterbr br i will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh
258,1,i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership
259,2,this product has a strong aftertaste of crayola crayonsbr br i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes  upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in itbr br i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchasedbr br to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans  the flavor is fantastic  however they do not supply a gallonsized tuband dr mercola has the best product in that size category
260,5,had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs  stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking too good product good value
261,5,these are healthy and my mixed llasa tibetan terrier adores them and they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products a great healthy product
262,5,a great healthy chew for my  wk old beagle rio he loves the taste and it sure beats my arm
263,5,i really enjoy this product i had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store once i found it i look no further its the only sugar i use  thanks so much
264,3,i have used and liked sugar in the raw for many years after being introduced to it in a starbucks my most recent purchase however was disappointing the sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe th of the regular size having large crystals was something i always really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes i called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this they claimed also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a  digit date code without any spaces that ends with a  and no letters the trailing digits are a date code using the julian calendar my recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a a bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products when they get a better crop ill go back to purchasing sugar in the raw
265,5,sugar in the rawtm please harvest cane wo burningbr to be delivered to hcsbr dear sugar in the raw folksbr br we who buy your product care about the environment and wed like to know that you care too when you burn the cane fields on maui it adds to the co and worsens climate change and the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers your workers children and the residents of mauibr br we love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it knowing we arent contributing to global warming and lung diseasebr br 
266,5,love this sugar  i also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend
267,5,product is exactly as advertised  what a savings  at least half the retail price easy to store because of the individual packaging
268,1,i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or somethingbr br how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as wellbr br im just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice
269,4,its just sugar in the raw its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something i just wish the bags were resealable
270,4,this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big however  bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it it is a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer
271,4,i only use raw sugar it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again
272,5,this sugar is very good  use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar white sugar will taste terrible  plus from what ive read this raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our dietsbr br the product was delivered fast and wellpackaged  my only complaint is the price  i wish i could find raw sugar cheaper  i would be happy to buy in bulk but this is the cheapest i have found
273,3,i thought this was a great buy but as noted by scott d the molasses content was not up to par  i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw  unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve  ounce bags  i guess ill watch for the next crop
274,5,i really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else
275,5,love this sugar it tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff
276,4,cant say anything bad about sugar in the raw  i like it better than the other natural sugars better consistency and  i know it doesnt matter  but better color unfortunately one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box  it didnt look like the box was damaged so i cant tell how it happened but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when i opened it  not sure what the solution is and id order it again but if it happens again id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag
277,5,great service items arrived faster than expected very efficient will use this seller again i highly recommend this seller thank you for the excellent service
278,5,please ignore the onestar comments if you check the bag the main ingredient is in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower with anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in for someone who has celiac disease and cannot have sunchips because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip cookie or cereal this is an excellent product my spouse and i buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious
279,5,best flavor ever  im addicted  they are all good but these are by far the best  i could live on these  and there is no need for anymore to say
280,5,so many healthy products dont taste very good  or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill  ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty  ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them its also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabeticbut i would eat them anyway
281,5,i found these crisps at our local walmart  figured i would give them a try they were so yummy i may never go back to regular chips not that i was a big chip fan anyway the only problem is i can eat the entire bag in one sitting i give these crisps a big thumbs up
282,5,this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten i only buy it on special occassions because i know ill eat the whole bag
283,1,i paid  for a  ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb  as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients  the name is deceptive  these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste  i wont buy these again  i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste
284,5,i use the rotel mild and i love this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis  if youre trying to cook lower fat healthier foods and in a hurry this stuff makes it so much easier  ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever  for some reason this product doesnt have that  it tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans heat and eatbr br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup  i also make indian dishes with this and spicey spaghetti sauce  i also prefer this to most canned salsas so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid offbr br none of my local grocery stores carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it  so i have to pay amazons inflated price to order this by the case  i dont like that im paying a higher price but i love love love the product
285,5,the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for  dissapointing
286,3,howdy yallbr br the actual product is very good  id rate the item a  on its own however its only one dollar at the local grocery and   twenty eight dollars per twelve pack  these are running almost two and a half dollars eachbr br as i said too expensive sigh  i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local costbr br take carebr lee
287,3,nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me in texas i was called a babymouth  not into very spicyhot foodsbr br for comparison im comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa  can of this milder rotel mixed with  slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips i used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though
288,5,this is a fantastic product and i wish it was readily available in most stores its taste is not the greatest but its a  oz shot and its gone in a second it tastes more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record ive had  hour energy and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results its got mg of caffeine which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters i cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at g which isnt horrible i used to drink  oz red bulls a day for the caffeine and this gives me far better energy and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee but i cant drink  cups a day anymore overall steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts and they create big results
289,5,i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one  hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a jittery feeling almost headachy but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptical but for me it works as well if not better than the  hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almostheadache feelingbr br i dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost  each yikebr br and its organicso i can feel good about it right its all about me feeling good
290,5,i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff
291,3,i am a energy junkie and im not sure if this works or not but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steaz energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is  more natural then the others
292,5,if you want an organic energy shot your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks and they both use sambazon acai so there are some similarities in ingredientsbr br great energy burst for  hours on a steaz energy shot and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my iced coffees which are not helping my calorie intakebr br already ordering packs on subscribe and save  per month great value
293,5,i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favoritebr br i recently had gastric bypass surgery so tons of sugar is a nono and im also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are outbr br i tried bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as steaz and definitely didnt taste as well these have a taste thats almost like cocacolanot bad at allbr br if youre looking for natural energy give these a try
294,5,i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i dont like the taste of either of them this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive its worth the  per shot we normally split them im really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body ill be ordering again soon for sure 
295,3,i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable
296,5,ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software engineer this is entirely unacceptable so i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the daybr br she excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was my brain is still working at unnatural speeds to summarize my experiences i believe this worksbr br she did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it which i personally feel helped the energy level so if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot  preferably before you eat anythingbr br woot
297,4,the energy shot truly does work it had a terrible aftertaste at first but now that i know what to expect i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chaserwhich helps i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages its helped me kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages yay
298,5,ive tried hour energy red rain nos and other energy shots  this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect  plus its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used  sometimes i wonder what im really putting into my body with some of the other brands  i purchase a box about once every  months for the past  years
299,5,if youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals this is a great option  the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters
300,5,i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious  i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are  mg of caffeine in each bottlebr it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of  on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah
301,5,i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all its also the best taste others taste like medicine this one has a tea fresh taste i love it
302,5,i drive otrover the road truck and this helps to keep me alert it has no sugar high  no crash im on a autoship which i like the price is very good ive seen it over  bucks in the store
303,5,products takes pretty good and it doesnt leave you gittery  with subscibe and save as well as prime membership i pay below   a shot  my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style  i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training  i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink
304,5,i use this product daily and it provides a steady stream of energy  i do not get jittery or crash  it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant
305,5,ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now and the energy boost is excellent with a continuous hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well or perhaps im getting more used to it i dont drink it for the flavor but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other nonorganic energy shots
306,1,this is the first time ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like hr energy i find rain ok and so i thought id try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards  tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and dont work dont buy this i dont know what to do with the other  bottles big fail
307,4,i loved this mold  i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion but it didnt last  i did use it to make  suckers for my daughters first birthday but there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that  i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions but for the price it didnt matter to me that much  it served its main purpose 
308,5,you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls  the regular chocolate ones are good but these are the best ever
309,5,try this you might like it i did and i am quite addicted it is too easy to prepare it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with the price is really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of couscous like i do then give this one a tryit can be eaten hot room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed i cooked the couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time i will be back for more
310,5,this tricolor couscous is really goodfull of flavor and fun to eat  i love the texture  i cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs parsley cilantro along with some red pepper flakes  at the end of cooking i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dishhighly recommend
311,5,i tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck  so i decided to try good ole amazoncom and selected this product  it is so goodadd a few herbs and its a great side dish or add more and make a pasta type saladso very good  i am hooked  great flavor and so easy to prepare
312,1,the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried  cup water to  cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit covered for min it was mushy and tastelesswe have thrown out the rest of the container
313,1,i wouldnt even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit how can i compare other items online or in a store
314,5,i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon  i like this so much that this my first product review  i have to say that im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but i thought i would give it a try  when my husband started grinding it up i could smell it throughout the house  sometimes with flavored coffees the smell is there but the taste isnt  however not with this one  im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try
315,5,i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i dont have a grinder and use a blender instead but its worth it many flavored coffees ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee but this one manages both
316,5,this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time  ive believe the company is local  ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it  im particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavors are good  i cant say that ive had a bad onebr br as it turns out its less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it  its a no brainer  try it if you like rich flavored coffee youll like it
317,5,it is hot i love it tasty and a little sweet i usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot but this one lives up to its billing
318,5,i consume about a jar every two weeks of this either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip  it is hot but after awhile the medium salsa suprema was too mild for me i thought maybe id cut down how much i ate by going to the hot salsa ranchera  its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say thats hotbr br flavor bright and forward  the similarly hot salsa victoria is a duller taste to me i guess earthy  this salsa is much brighter in the mouth  i dont like to go hotter than this because the sauces ive tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with tabasco sauce for examplebr br a drawback is la victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of salsa ranchera nor salsa victoria nor do they sell them in  or sams club  to get a good deal you have to watch for sales
319,5,service was great but i meant to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade br br love the sauce  have yet to try the marinade
320,5,use frequently as we like to do asian dishes at least once a week  love this product  fast shipping as usual  would buy again
321,5,these individually wrapped pieces are delicious although i wish there were a few more mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste even a traditional marzipanaholic should enjoy these
322,5,put this in my husbands stocking for christmas and it was a hit
323,3,i was amazed at how quickly it arrived  it is a cute stocking stuffer but only ok as far as user appeal  you get what you pay for
324,3,toy was typical quality i expected  i got taken for a major ride on the shipping
325,1,so we cancelled the order  it was cancelled without any problem  that is a positive note
326,5,i love the convenience of the singles the best creamer aroundtaste is just like the big bottle i can stick them in my purse and take them to work
327,5,these creamers come in  packs of  i have taken one to work and opened one for home so far and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i wont allow myself more than  creamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping
328,4,even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d
329,5,besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers i liked this item specifically because of packaging i couldnt believe how many reviews i read about coffee creamer cups but many of the amazon creamer options both coffeemate and international delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packagingbr br that was not an issue here the shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of  each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes thus none of my cups were broken no waste and no sloppy drippy mess plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen one in the bathroom we moved our mini keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen keurig  best idea my husband ever had and one at work with a reserve for whichever runs out firstbr br if you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like i was by the negative packaging reviews on other options this is your best bet as a bonus the auto delivery price is very reasonable
330,5,this seller is very nice  and the price is very good  the only reason i stop ording is bacause i went to sugar free and at that time he did not have it  but for those of you that dont have to watch there fat in take i would get this product from them
331,5,i purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee tea bags  theyre great because they dont require refrigeration
332,1,i received the items in a timely manner upon receipt i removed a pack to consume the poptart was stale and left an awful taste in my mouth
333,5,i found these new spring poptarts and bought them on a whim  my kids and i were amazed and delighted at the fun colorful amazingly detailed artwork on these poptarts  fantastic for after school snacks lunch boxes and school treats tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift  the only challenge is finding more in stores  way to go kelloggs  fantastic product
334,5,yes i am having a cup right now  i went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee  i paid and extra  bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money highly recommend
335,1,taste like it is stale  will not order this again  i had this coffee at a th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it  this stuff tasted nothing like the douwe egberts at the hall  this is possibly stale coffee
336,1,serveice delivery with the seller was excellent the product was not will not order again bad taste iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes i throw it right away i coudl not drink it
337,5,this is honestly the best seasoning salt in all the land  it tightens up any dish not spicy just perfectly seasoned  its perfect hence my purchase of this  oz mamma jamma
338,5,the order arrived as advertised i have had only a few chances to use it but it is awesome the flavor is exactly what i hoped for it may take me a while to finish the entire gallon but i will definnantly order again
339,5,i like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly  great quality flavor and aroma  cant beat that its organic
340,5,bought a set of two when my son was about  months and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat  i cut up cantaloupe apple banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever i could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat  its great because i didnt have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks and he got to try out new foods  i wouldnt hesitate to buy this again
341,4,i have a slightly different version of this  different brand  my son started using it around six months and he really enjoys it  he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon but whatever  anyway i also had trouble cleaning it until i tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush  that works pretty well  it takes some time but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender or cut it up then clean it up off him the chair the floor the dog me well you get the picture
342,5,what a great idea my daughter love itbr i dont think is difficult to wash i mean is not like just toss water and thats it but come onbr absolutely recommend it
343,3,this product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned  i couldnt get the food pieces out to save my life i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests
344,5,i loved this product for fruits and other food that i didnt want my new baby to choke on  i also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething it worked great for this as well as for the food i didnt like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean
345,3,i love love love the idea of this product and my little one loves loves loves to use it  she gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and i dont have to worry about her choking  the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out  granted some foods are more difficult than others and some dont cause that much of a problem  bananas however have pretty much destroyed a couple of them  while i love this product i think that next time i will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags
346,3,the munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth while my daughter was interested in it for a little while she eventually lost interest i may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts
347,4,this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them super easy to clean and use when ordering these i was under the impression that there were  per packagefyitheyre not only one per
348,5,i ordered these for my coffee themed wedding when they arrived i had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good i literally had to hide the box to the wedding they were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables it was a great tasting product for the lowest price ive seen
349,5,these are delicious the chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose crunchy and not bittera hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbaduchocolate covered espresso beans  poundsa
350,5,the product was exactly as advertised and fresh  unfortunately i keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast  we need to reorder to keep up with demand
351,5,these chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful  the chocolate is very dark and rich and the bean inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing
352,5,popchips are so good  i have been following weight watchers and lost  pounds and am at my goal  these popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence  they taste so  good
353,5,ive purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix which is a great product by the way  this is the highest price ive seen  whole foods carries this item and its been on sale there for  thats canadian dollars too as im in canada  its even cheaper on bakers boxs own website and theyre the company selling this product through amazon for a twopack they should be charging  or less  what gives  i thought amazon was where you could find competitive prices
354,5,the sugar was sweet that can not be denied  as advertised it didnt melt when baked either  however it will not do for your liege wafflesgaufres what the larger pebbles of belgian pearl will do  these grains are smaller think pretzel salt or seed pearls
355,5,thats exactly what i was looking for to bake some chouquettes puffs with small sugar pearls on top works great yum
356,5,this is what i was looking for and was missing it the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india definitely recommend it
357,5,i bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than id original expected a common problem in some fruit winesbr br this is indeed good strawberry flavor  just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor and presto just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingersbr br for those interested i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be  oz of extract per  gallon of liquid
358,4,great stuff and dependable especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from  i love the stuff  for really high end desires i go with the apollo olive oils from california  but i buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again
359,4,i hadnt tried or heard of till recently weavers not its my favorite i am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and havent found one yet theyre all so darned smooth no bite no after taste a little pricy but still worth it no worse price wise than starbucks or peets will keep running through the list here and see what happens love them all so far
360,5,having always been a strict peets coffee lover i was reticent to switch brands but weavers won my heart the taste is clean and strong the ethos is correct organic baby and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate be still my caffeinated heart
361,5,go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of weavers peru organic whole bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee  and when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they dont know better take along a travel mug filled with weavers coffee from home and enjoy a real cup of joe  er weavers
362,1,a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream andor honey definately not my cup of coffee oh did i say it was bitter
363,5,im learning that latin american and south american coffees have this distinct coffee caramelish finish  as a peets coffee fanatics we learned that weavers roaster was the roaster for peets and we are hooked   i already reviewd the french and organic blend but i must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drinkbr met the weavers team at the warner brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast  since them we are fansbr you wont be dissapointed 
364,5,i like eating these whenever i need an energy boostbr it has everything that i am searching for in a to go snackbr fiber plus chocolate is never a bad thing
365,5,these are my favorite bars ever the combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful very filling these are hard to find in the stores im thankful for subsrcibe and save
366,5,my fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us dont carry them anymore  once again amazon came through and he couldnt be happier
367,5,i was buying quaker oats granola bars but these nature valley chewy bars are better tasting they make a great snack when im on the go chocolate peanuts and raisinsit doesnt get any better
368,5,hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school  he takes two bars now and is very happy to do so  it is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores  so again amazoncom came through with a reasonable price  now i came keep the husbands breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings  i often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack
369,4,"nantucket blend coffee is one of my favorites  i was suprised that it was a single box  every time i ordered before it was a  pack  my fault for not reading closer  i will not order any more at this price for   count

371,4,when we received our keurig elite for christmas we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors of the  pods we had in the box four were green mountain coffee brand id never tried anything from this company before but from what i had researched online they have the largest range of keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as wellbr br unfortunately i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee we tried their dark magic decaf and breakfast blend and all were underwhelming to say the least i was almost completely set on writing off green mountain altogtherbr br we had one gm pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot i figured id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely and im glad i didbr br the nantucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other gm blends we tried i added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto caribou blend pods almost all in all this is a very standard cup of coffee which while it isnt anything new or exciting is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options weve been able to test out when we run out of all the pods weve accumulated ill probably pick up a box of these as wellbr br now that i know green mountain isnt completely disappointing ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbiyiegreen mountain coffee golden french toast  kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers counta to try as well and see how it goes from therebr br if youre looking for a goto choice this is your cup
372,5,green mountain is my favorite brand nantucket is my favorite coffee from green mountain very smooth flavor not too strong and not too weak
373,4,i was looking for a replacement for timothys kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon  this coffee from green mountain is very nice but not strong enough for me  if you like milder coffees then this one is for you
374,5,one of green mountains best blends of coffee in my opinionlove it for your everyday blend perfect stregnth excellent blend
375,5,this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup the best i have ever eaten with large hearty chunks of chickenand vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied and is seasoned just right  i am so glad amazon carries this product  i just cant find it here in vermont
376,5,i have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking  i love the regular i use it on everything you wont be sorry you tired it great for dipping bread and cooking omelet and green beans
377,5,oh my gosh is this good  like most people ive been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it  then hubby brought a jar of this home  the tomato flavor is amazing  i will never buy store ketchup every again
378,5,sir kensingtons did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product the refreshed taste of this ketchup is a great update and now leaves me disappointed when im given heinz while out at a restaurantbr br for you heinz die hard fans out there this is not the ketchup for you but for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in heinz be sure to give this ketchup a trybr br dont forget the spiced variety purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first sir kensington experience is definitely the way to go
379,5,this is ridiculous  the best gourmet ketchup i have ever tasted  it is pricey but wowlove this stuff  it would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup  yummy
380,5,the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor  it is clean and really fresh  perfect on an avocado chicken sandwichbr br the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried  it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy
381,3,the spicy version of this ketchup isnt bad but it is too expensive  the regular version is sweet as dessert  horrible  annies organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less  even heinz organic is a better deal  i gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass not plastic
382,1,these condiments are overpriced and terrible the classic is disgustingly sweet the spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant
383,5,i have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years the roland extra fancy porcinis that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and transported back to the usa
384,5,i was pretty pleased with these mushrooms they were mostly large pieces rehydrated well and had good flavor id estimate about  of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces most likely due to the shaking about in transit not a problem since i sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes there was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very smallmincedsizedustlike pieces still useful to add into gravies and the like nothing gets wastedbr br the label says it is a product of china and italy nothing was specified as to the proportion from each countrybr br im quite fond of dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additionally i find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews to save time and add flavor i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them really helps meld all the flavors together i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta the pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused waterbr br this was the first time i used the roland brand got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse and would certainly buy them again highly recommend
385,5,if you are a peanut lover these are for you much larger than cocktail peanuts six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year
386,5,the cashews were nice and big with the vast majority being whole  there were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag but thats pretty expected with so many cashews  they made an absolutely excellent cashew brittlebr br my order took just over a week to arrive which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country  they came double bagged in clear plastic bags and in two  lb portions  this was highly convenient since i could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until i was ready to work with itbr br great value for the price
387,4,although there were several shriveled ones they taste just fine  i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyways  for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store
388,5,i ordered these after a fair bit of searching online  even ordering the smaller oz bags i will admit i was a bit sceptical when i ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cashews would bebr br the order came in pretty fast  like  days the cashews were fresh and whole  with like  broken pieces they were in  lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longerbr br the only negative i can think of is that the price went up abt  for the lb since i bought them
389,5,these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty  they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can
390,4,i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that i have at a couple of restaurants plus he likes nuts pecans almonds peanuts he loved these i actually ordered  cans instead of the gift tin so he could take one to work or his place and stay fresh longer although i dont think freshness will be an issue they wont last longlol
391,2,my cat will go for a day probably longer havent tryed it but hell walk right by this stuff every time even when i know hes hungery absolutely no interest i swear hed rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it
392,5,got this free with another order i placed  i couldnt believe how much the cats loved it i will buy again for sure
393,5,this is a great ham soup base  i have used it in ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans  great flavor
394,1,i havent used the ham base it is loaded with msg i did not realize this when i ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item
395,5,before i discover this mix on amazon i always bought it in whole food storebr i like this mix and when i am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffybr just one small secret try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one
396,5,i appreciate the fact that i can buy this product online and have free shipping this is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture thanks again amazon
397,5,arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix is my favorite mix  it tastes great cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make  although it can be made using water i think its better made with milk  i love it with pure organic maple syrup
398,5,the pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my sons egg allergy  its also great for camping or any time youd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available
399,5,hey these are great waffles and pancakes we have to add  more mix tho as the recipies on the bag are very thin but we have a lot of fun with this arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake  waffle mix we serve them as is with fried eggs and real maple syrup a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtsqbutternut mountain farm vermont pure maple syrup grade a dark amber  pint juga or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream or cool whip or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle or add  cup sugar and  cup malted milk powder a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeqhvccarnation malted milk original ounce jars pack of a for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the hilton its handy to have extra bags on hand too and you cant beat the subscribe and save price this mix is  organic too
400,4,we are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergybr they taste fine for our family we like them many ways
401,3,i love the flour however amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product
402,1,this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box  bags out of  had come unsealed at the top there were no tears in the packages
403,1,just awful  i thought food was supposed to taste good  i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth its that bad
404,1,perhaps the worst bottle of wine ive ever had im not even sure i would cook with this it is thin no body and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot  the taste is just bitter  not the complexity that i expect from a pinot noir of any price just not what im looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir maybe my bottle wasnt sealed well and went to vinegar  other reviews for this wine are favorable
405,5,a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition  everyone get the munchiesis this is a good alternative to eating potato chips
406,5,this is a wonderful warm flavored tea especially now in colder weatherbr this tea has a sweetsoothing chamomile fragrance it is subtle and sweetits one of the better chamomile teasbr if you find it hard to sleep at times a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may helpbr if you really like sweet taste try bigelow chamomile mango herbal teabr i highly recommend both
407,5,this is one of the best mint chocolate syrup ive ever had so far  the others pale in flavor by comparison  there are only seven ingredients in this sauce including organic natural mint flavor  in the past i used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch chocolate chips oreo cookies caramel et al because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale  now i buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the santa cruz organic mint chocolate syrup really stands out but doesnt overpower the flavor of the ice cream there are only  calories  and because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste i use it sparingly so this  oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups i used
408,5,this is a simple product and it is simply good  there are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are  it is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out  this will be great for people who like mint it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate  i use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half tastes great  sometimes simple is better
409,5,a grande item   delicious fish with the ultimate flavor best  ever in a can for all purposes   i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties 
410,5,i ordered this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon  the raincoast trading co salmon is very tasty equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland  however the raincoast arrived in perfect condition the kirkland cans were dented badly  i recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon
411,5,this tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an indian restaurant its much better than getting a teabag and making it the english way with a lot of water and a bit of milk this is very creamy and tasty my only criticism is that there arent enough sachets in the box only  since the directions say that you use one sachet for ml of water approximately half a cup its not enough for a good cup of tea so i use two that means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea but its a delicious afterdinner drink i would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box
412,5,i love this product cant find it locally sometimes little out of the way stores have itbut i also love the chickenpork chop bagsevery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market
413,5,this is the best way to cook a roast  our local grocery went out of buisness and so i could not find this product till i looked here  please continue to keep this product available
414,5,its always a pleasure to find frenchs products on the web  all of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but mccormacks bland and tasteless seasoningsbr br this is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find
415,5,if you like oreos or the oreo cakester then youve got to try the double stuff cakesters these are the best side note shipping was very slow but maybe your chances will be better
416,5,i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when i told them i bought this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt pepper spinach and some cheese and its a great easy meal
417,5,the thing about marmite is that those who dont like it hate it and those who love it cant live without it  its very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in victoria beckham is marmite meaning that those who dont like heretc  amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price  last time i looked it was  a g jar in british stores in lacounty or about x what it costs in england  the amazon supplier was quick and efficient and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have if i didnt decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan  good job amazon
418,1,a vile miserable pancake i put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried i dont know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix the buttermilk baking soda sls and sea salt are not i am going back to natures path buttermilk pancake mix this one went straight into the garbage
419,5,whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie the only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast hope these dont go the way of the dinosaur
420,4,these arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap  the cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery storebr br i have no complaints but i also now have no more cookies we ate them all
421,5,i was not expecting to like these cookies as much as i do i like chocolate chip cookies well enough but i really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones i have to say these famous amos cookies have pertty much turned me around the cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients the chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing these are truly great cookies
422,5,they arent fattening and theyre good for you right thats what i heard at least from an admittedly unreliable person
423,4,great if you are cutting back on fat they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them extremely dry and hard
424,5,i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like these chips have a great loaded potato flavor which are flavorful i like the sweet onion chips better but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips kettle chips are great chips fthe money
425,5,after buying bags one at a time at a hefty markup at nearby stores i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon i was very pleased with the price and the productsbr br these jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag which im embarrassed to say i did quite a few timesbr br the chips arrived wellpacked and fresh they had nearly a year of time before they expired which is pretty impressive for chipsbr br most importantly the priceperbag was much much better than any local store could do although i live near an expensive city so that may play a role in the price differencebr br i wouldnt hesitate to order another box of these once i run out
426,4,i buy mostly for vending so the size of the bag is important kettles  oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full salt  vinegar flavor is satisfying about an  out of 
427,4,glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full its hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well sometimes they are too wide or too plump with air bag size is good bbq flavor is about an  out of 
428,5,one of the best chips that you can buyand ive tried all the kettle varieties and many others  theres only a slight taste of jalapeno and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alonebr if you like being addicted these are the chip for you see you at addicts anonymous
429,5,the title says it all great flavor hint of spice excellent crunch we eat kettle chips by the truck load at my house we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite never enough bags to get us to our next shipment i just wish amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save if you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself
430,5,wow  i have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day kettle chips are the best nonbaked chips i have eaten i decided to try the sweet onion chips since ive never had them i now have a favorite if you like onions this is a must buy i will definitely reorder these as i mentioned above they are the best i have ever eaten the flavor is great
431,5,i cannot say how much i love kettle brand potato chips kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water the ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in i love that these arent filled with nasty chemicals i ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but i was torn between the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbifusckettle brand potato chips fully loaded baked potato ounce pack of a and the jalapeno flavor while i know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better they include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which im fine with since ive a vegetarian i ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and i cant guarantee how many i will have left my fiance and i love these the packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches or handing out in gift bags even just for portion control
432,5,now i havent done a sidebyside comparison but these chips still taste like the real deal these snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store i work for portion control and reduced fat yes please  with the subscribe  save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store
433,4,i love kettle brand chipsbr ive been in love with the honey dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavorsbr br sea salt  vinegar chips are tangy sour and make my lips pucker when i eat too many at a time  i got  big bags for a steal from amazon  whatbr br personally the flavor is too much for me but my mom  aunt love them and they hate potato chips
434,5,these chips are thick and crunchy  i absolutely love them  the taste is perfect  i like to buy these smaller bags because i cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good
435,4,i enjoy these chips i got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change i think those are better but only slightly like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering the small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag
436,5,i love these chips i buy the  pack once a month the bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags the jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor
437,5,these are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips ive had  i could still do with more vinegar flavor but i think this is as close as im going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myselfbr br i did a side by side with the cape cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful  additionally as other reviewers have said they have quite a good bit of potassium in them somewhere in the neighbor of  rda per serving
438,5,i have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a yeari love thembut my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoritewill be ordering them
439,5,these are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips  many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so its nice to find ones that i can eat  the vinegar flavor is really intense and good
440,4,these kettle brand potato chips in the spicy thai flavor really do taste like food i have eaten at a thai restaurant the ingredients listed include garlic powder onion powder parsley jalapeno and spices im not sure what other spices there are but it sure tastes like lemongrass to meyum these chips are thick cut and very crunch they come in a seriously heavyduty bag i tried to open it like i do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way the bag is so thick i wondered if it was plastic i started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it sure enough there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here so easy why didnt i think of that
441,3,honey dijon flavor okay flavor but both my girlfriend and i thought they left a bad aftertaste the aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this im not a fancy cheese eater and it lingers for at least an hour id give this flavor a rating of  stars out of br br we have also tried the ny cheddar flavor  stars which we both liked better and they didnt leave any longlingering or bad aftertastebr br id give the consistency of the chips  stars the chips are crunchy but also greasy enough that i keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating kettle chips
442,5,for me kettle is the best brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods i didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips but these are my new favorite the flavors are pure and real they go great with just about everything and are highly addictive i hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors
443,4,salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste
444,5,what i like about thembr  very thick chipsbr  no trans fat and all natural according to the info on the bagbr  flavor but thats a subjective thingbr  oz bags which keep you from eating too much at one time just set a limit of  bagbr br consbr as another reviewer said theres a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off but its true and at least this way youll get rid of some of the oil
445,5,these are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many a handful or two does the trick very crisp and savory
446,3,i usually love kettle chips and love salt  vinegar but these chips were way too vinegary for me they do have the typical kettle chip crunch but are too aggressively flavored for my taste
447,4,i have always been a fan of kettle chips  when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality  these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the packagebr br the new york cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them  you can taste the cheddar in them but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might  the taste lingers as well which is a definite plusbr br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp that crunch in your mouth  on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase  the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven  some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain  this isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at allbr br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic  the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed  especially if you are a cheddar lover
448,5,tried many varieties of bbq chips and hands down these are the best on the market these r not too salty or greasy great crispy crunch plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of every bag after bag is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the st
449,5,kettle chis are the best ever these used to be my favorite flavor until i tried their salt and pepper kind but im sure this is just a personal preferencebr br crunchy real potato chips
450,5,these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning i like the oz size bags just the right amount of chips
451,5,i subscribed to these  one case every three months that comes out to about  a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever i want because it seems fritolay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items i want rather than the items fritolay wants me to have the two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the subway for example which i find works very well  theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh  no chip clip neededbr br the only problem i subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kids
452,3,oki did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful i took the plunge as i do like salty and tangy flavors no i had never had these before i took the leap and ordered a case at a super price they arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  feb  umm im in the middle on these chips they are ok but not something i cant live without i love the crunch the color no trans fat they are a little too vinegary for my taste which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feetbr br i havent tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience 
453,5,this was the best deal ever the delivery was fast the chips are delicious and very fresh  love it
454,5,my husband and i love these chips personally i think the flavor is perfect try them for yourself
455,5,the barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect just spicy enough a hint of sweetness just a little smokey the chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial but not hard this makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers hot dogs or brats chicken or just about any casual entree
456,5,i was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store lunds but they were on sale so i bought a bag  ive found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips like cheddar or vinegar usually results in disappointment  tried the thai or asianinspired chips by target archer farms and they were awful  these kettle spicy thai chips are just awesomeso much so that im considering buying them in bulk from amazon  the taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate  the taste sensations prevalent in real thai food is baked into this chipsweet salty spicy  was sour in there too  i dont know but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting
457,5,as a professional potato chip muncher i see these as thee very best on the market rich taste and flavor almost impossible not to finish the entire bagthe true meaning of decadence
458,5,these are handsdown the absolute best salt  vinegar chips you can buy  they have a great strong flavor that has left me addicted  these are certainly my favorite chips  i highly recommend trying them
459,5,oh i love these chips and theyre so hard to find where i am and when i do find them theyre usually  more per bag for less great that these are so cheap here at amazon
460,5,i love these chips  it is a little weird to review potato chips  but these chips are great the crunch is just right plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salty not too bland they are a little oily but thats ok the best thing is the  oz package when i buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all  this  oz package allows for a little portion control be sure to use your scissors to open cause these chips are packaged for freshness and dont open easily enjoy
461,4,in the past couple years i have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips  from the best ive ever had to big disappointments  if you have eaten the lantchips varieties there is no way that they are not the best as a group the kettle chips are rightly salted and i was so irritated by some pringles products  kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors  all in all its good to have choiceamazon does not stock the lantchips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice
462,4,these chips are good and bad and create moral dilemmas constantly if wou are strong at will or having a large bbq go for it but as for me i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it beware
463,5,kettle chips flavors can be hit or miss  some of their flavors are terrible  but this is very simple and delicious  probably one of their best flavorsbr br pros thick crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesnt compromise on taste ecofriendly business that isnt just giving us lip servicebr br cons the occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open  they have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time i end up tearing down the entire side of the bag  use scissors instead
464,5,we bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in sonoma while we were on vacation i wasnt sure what to expect by the package and at first bite i didnt know what to thinkand then all of the flavors hitbr yum they are a bit spicy but nothing overpowering just lots of crunchy sweet spicy goodness they arent sold everywhere though im still trying to find them somewhere close to where i live
465,5,i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive i cant stop eating them its crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect believe me some chips are so salty i cant finish a small bag but this one i just keep on eating
466,5,these are some of the best chips that i have ever had they sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands they are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time these will be the only chips that i buy from now on and i thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time
467,5,im addicted to salty and tangy flavors so when i opened my first bag of sea salt  vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgmbvkettle chips honey dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgqgmkettle chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly
468,5,these honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty tangy sweet and crunchy other brands ive tried use too much mustard flavor which overpowers the honey dijon pairingbr br these chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally they also go down great with beerbr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend these other kettle chips flavors a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgmbuakettle chips sea salt  vinegara and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgqgmkettle chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly
469,5,these chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school they are by far the tastiest chips ive had and its impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag
470,5,these are by far my favorite chips they are extremely crunchy similar to other kettle style chips but its the extreme vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks  ive tried several other brands of salt and vinegar and none of them come close
471,4,they are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut i much prefer the salt  pepper just for the krinkle cut  they have a better texture all around this brand is much better than fritolay and a good price on amazon when you get free shipping these are similar to tims or zacks chips in that they are very crispybr br on a side note these are the hardest bags to open by hand i have to use a knife or scissors everytime
472,4,it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends
473,4,these are delicious  the  oz bags are a bit big for school lunches definitely more than a serving
474,4,i recently tried this flavorbrand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are  the best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the bsg my favorite so i bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends  i am a little disappointed that there are not so far very many brown chips in these bags but the flavor is still very good  i like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty and the onion flavor is better  if you havent eaten kettle chips before i recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk  they are thicker and crunchier than lays but just as fresh out of the bag
475,5,we are always pleased with amazons packaging chips are never crushed or broken always fresh we really liked this brandflavor of chips very tasty
476,5,these chips are some of the best ive tasted they are not filled with chemicals you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you dont like salt and vinegar tanginess dont even bother to try these definitely have zip i love them my children and their friends love them even my  year old loves them
477,5,these chips were a great deal  kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips  they are hard to find in vegas and are my favorite flavor shipping was very fast sooner than expected
478,5,fantasticyou can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
479,4,eat at your own risk  once i would open a bag i could not stop  good and salty
480,5,i dont eat many chips but these i love great buy and arrived quick and packed great expiration date is a ways away so i have awhile to enjoy them great natural potato flavor i love brown russet hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee
481,5,i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends    my experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side  but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind  thanks to amazon for great discounts and i dont have to buy them from the store anymore
482,5,bought this box of chips as a fathers day gift because dad loves them  they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips
483,5,these chips are quite tasty and the price is right  packaged very well would buy again
484,2,i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked  i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i dont know why these were differentbr will never buy these chips from here again
485,5,for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaskaso i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them  they are very good chips amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing  i would order groceries online
486,4,my husband likes these a lot they are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy they are more browner than i would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture not bad though just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health they do have about  the calories in fat however
487,4,just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me if it is there
488,2,i really love kettle brand chips but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor
489,3,i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgqgmkettle chips spicy thai ounce bags pack of a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan cheddar blue cheese garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked but i do not plan to buy them again
490,5,i took one and said good russet potato chip but where is the flavoring then all of a sudden within seconds it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get  these chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming the flavoring included garlic ginger jalapeno cilantro and other spices and it just felt great to eat these i will buy these again these were a treat
491,2,i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the saltvinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that
492,5,we love kettle chips lightly salted and dont feel guilty eating them  we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money  we have purchased at least  times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery
493,5,a friend of mine brought these into work with the claim  these will change your life  while my life is fairly unchanged i cannot get enough of these chips     and i do not even like kettle chips  for the most part i find kettle chips to be too thick and greasy but the flavor of these chips is amazing  the are the type of hot that is refreshing  if you do not enjoy spicy or hot things    try these anyway they may convert you
494,5,but if you happen to like me there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip ive found in this country
495,5,these are the best potato chips ive ever tasted  its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping  the texturecrunchiness is just perfect as is the salt and vinegar combination  i dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips ive ever had but they do  and judging from the nutrition facts they seem to be healthier too  theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normalbr br and if you like these all of the kettle chips are great
496,5,i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them they are really amazing i love cheddar too but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor i recommend them
497,5,this is easily the best potato chip that i have ever had  look at the ingredients  ginger and  types of hot pepper  how can you go wrongbr br obviously not for you if you dont like spicy food but if you do like spicy food youll probably love these  they have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of thai food
498,4,kettle chips spicy thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet savory and spicy everything youd want in a good meal or better yeta potato chip  since these are kettlecooked the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned  they are however sliced just perfectly not too thick not too thin so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off  the flavor is tremendous although i wouldnt describe it as thai  its more of a vague sweet and tangy flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger  if you like any spice at all these really are not overly spicy so most people can handle them  the fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any munchers snack cupboard
499,4,okay i should not eat potato chips nor should anyonebr but these are so spicy i would find it hard to eatbr very many that makes them an indulgence thatbr rescues some people from overindulgence
500,5,i dont write very many reviews but i have to say that kettle brand chips are the best i have ever tasted  every flavor is dynamite  if you are feeling iffy about honey dijon i would recommend cheddar beer absolutely amazing  and theyre healthy  besides a lil fat  i have eaten a lot of chips in my day and kettle takes the cake  enjoy and dont eat them too fast
501,5,i bought these for the office and no one can put them down im ordering more today and it has only been  weeks didnt have to shop for them either amazon brought it to my door
502,2,it was a great value and i like the package size but not vinegary enough for me wont order this brand again great chips otherwise
503,5,perfect they are my favorite because i can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt
504,4,amazons suggestion for a  star review is i like it  that being said i gave a  star review to the spicy thai chips  these chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip but whose taste buds dont appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor  the only thing i really dislike about these chips along with the rest of the flavors is that the serving size is half the bag  really  who can eat half and save the rest for later  not me
505,5,these are a favorite at our home we like the ones that have sea salt we also like barbeque  flavored these are not ruffly chips that have ridges these are thickly cut plain slice potatoes they are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth they also have a great taste the sea salt ones which are a favorite have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chipsbr br enjoy
506,5,these are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many  they have the best potato flavor  they came when you said they would
507,5,great chips great price  odds are that you will have them to yourself  if you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar you will love these  the best salt and vinegar chips i have ever had and i love this flavor mind you  they are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own  since i have found that sv is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species i know that my afternoon snack is all mine unless of course i run into another heavy brained hearty breathed like mind  summary if you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels  it is the first and only time i have committed to a whole case of chips and i will do it again  mmmmm vinegar
508,2,i was really looking forward to trying these chips since i love cheese but i was super disappointed i am a big fan of kettle chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain they are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of thatits annoying i do not recommend this flavorsalt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite
509,1,these are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouthbr br for my entire life sour cream  onion and in this case  chive chips were my favorite recently kettle brand honey dijon mustard took that slot so when i found out they had sour cream  onion i just had to try thembr br as soon as i opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk and indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful it tastes like rancid milk not just sour but like sour cream that when rancid the powdery texture is also extremely unappealing i basically hated these chips i would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery chalky texture on a chip with a rancid and onion flavor and i have a hard time believing that person existsbr br i plan on contacting kettle and sharing my thoughts with them hopefully theyll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips
510,1,kettle chips now look feel and taste like lays  these chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty  now no longer my favorite
511,5,great price for an excellent chip at about  cents for a  ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip everyone ive let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste ive yet to find a kettle chip that disappointed
512,4,i love these chips which is why i bought them to stock up for the entire school year the chips taste great and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived the box on the other hand was in tatters with holes and complely squished i dont know if that was a result of customs or the voyage but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart luckily there were no victims within all the chips are as they should be
513,3,this is the first time i tried sea salt  vinegar chips not my taste  make sure you like salt  vinegar before ordering you may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before  ill stick with the salt and black pepper chips
514,5,totally orgasmic  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted  signed up for the subscribe and save option  the case contained fifteen full sized bags of chips  the price per unit equals   per package  that is not even the cost of plain chips  if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery this deal is a steal  so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the spicy thai chips  ps  even if you paid the going price of  you are still ahead of the curve  enjoy
515,5,seriously now tasty tasty tasty fresh toobr br the only problem is that you have a pack of  and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings or grabbing multiple bags to begin with pace yourself i keep sayingbr br you cant go wrong with these if youre a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavorbr br ounce bags are about double the size of the kids bags about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks its really a good size for an adultbr br its a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips but it has  calories per bag again not too bad but something to think aboutbr br bottomline delicious
516,5,despite coming in an extremely large box i found this to be great value all the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away id definitely recommend
517,1,these were nasty they were so greasy and too rich for my blood plus they lacked major flavor no spicy jalapeno flavor at all  i was so dissapointed in these chips i am always hearing great things about these chips but i am telling you yuck yuck yuck  give me pain chips any day  maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but i am staying clear from these chips i wish i could give these zero stars if i could
518,4,if you like spicy then these are for you  i like spicy so i enjoyed these  theyre also crunchy as kettlecooked chips should be
519,3,these are decent but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip try boulders salt and malt vinegar chips  those are awesome
520,2,being a saltfree product is why i purchased this but the chips are quite greasy
521,5,these are the best potato chips that money can buy  there is just enough salt to taste it but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after youve wolfed down a bag of these beauties  each chip has the perfect thickness  my teeth get excited every time i put one in my mouth  everything about these chips is so perfect its like they were made by god and delivered by gabriel himself  now that i know amazon carries these i dont even have to leave my house to buy them  i may never eat anything else again
522,3,these things are just too darn cheesy if you like a lot of flavor youll love these otherwise you will overdose on their cheddary goodness
523,5,i first discovered kettle chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at trader joes with my daughter mindy  i couldnt believe how tasty they were the best chip i had ever eaten  it was love at first bite and ive been munching them ever sincebr br other things in their favor theyre thicker than other chips so dont crumble as im devouring them theyre delightfully crunchy and the saltandvinegar combination is heavenly  i tried to create an original line to describe this palatepleasing taste treat but couldnt beat what the manufacturer said tonguepuckering tang and crunch  isnt that poeticbr br as for health values since kettle chips are not peeled during preparation im getting more nutrition such as potassium and vitamin c  my mother would approve of that and the fact that theyre handcooked in small batchesbr br i often enjoy kettle chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea but theyre also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch  well actually kettle chips go perfect with everything  except sweets of coursebr br my only problem is that theyre so delicious i cant stop eating them  thats the reason i chose these smaller packets i figured  could last me almost a month if i was a good girl kept my appetite under controland hid them from the kids  for the sake of fewer calories i try hard and have succeeded so far  it isnt easy but br br have i told you how much i love thembr br reviewed by betty dravis br millennium babe the prophecy
524,5,you dont need salt to hide the taste of potato chips and these chips prove it the taste of the potato comes through instead of being masked ok so theyre still a snack food but no salt and no transfats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get and if youre on a lowsalt diet like i am having these available means i can eat chips and kettle are just the best
525,5,these potato chips are excellentthere are no trans fatsbr br they taste absolutely deliciouswhenever i am in the mood for potatoe chips kettles is the brand i buybr br a great product that anyone should enjoy and i highly recommend thembr br enjoy
526,5,it feels strange to review chips but i am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips kettle has lots of flavors but i always go back to these regular lightly saltedbr br they are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag plus they often looked burned they are not actually burned it has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark i love to open a bag and find some browned chipsbr br lays and wise have their place but ive become a chip snob thanks to kettlebr br like edys or breyers ice cream some products are worth the money these are the best of the best
527,5,i have tried a lot of sv chips and these are the best  real sea salt and real vinegar  mouthwatering flavor  crispiness  not for the faint of heart  the flavor is very authentic  
528,5,kettle brand chips are very crunchy  i would say regular plain old lays potato chips are at the soft end of the softcrunchy spectrum  ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest but kettle brand chips are far more crunchy  if you have a tender mouth or bad teeth dentures you might want to steer clear of kettle brand  otherwise youll love these chips  the sea salt  vinegar chips are super tangy  i enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time  i am dissapointed with all other salt  vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft andor the vinegar taste whimpy andor chemically  rest assured kettle sea salt  vinegar has a gourmet flavor  the vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could never be called whimpy
529,1,i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy  i discovered them when i was in england back in  and quickly became a fan  about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket  i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it  after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to  they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed  so i emailed kettle with the following  what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i dont know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about  years now so i am wondering  i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brandâ® chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologizeour potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatthanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag  this really helps when passing on your comments to our staffbr we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brandâ® flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timebr thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within  weeks  please let me know if i can be of any more help  well the next bag was good  since that time i have picked up  bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost  i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company  so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle  acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand  stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same
530,5,someone brought these to a party we had last month and i didnt put them out because the buffet was full and didnt think anyone would like saltless potato chips  last week we had some friends over and these were all i had in the pantry so i put them out  oh my gosh they are so good  i was so wrong to think they would be bland they are full of real potato flavor wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting  i am here on amazon to buy a case i only want to have these with dips  truly delicious
531,5,these backyard bbq kettle chips were a great deal with the promo code  it was nice to have a larger size bag  some kettle chips in the grocery store are only about  ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch  they arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from amazon grocery have been  great flavor and all natural
532,5,i have tried herrs utz wise pringles lays etcbut kettle tasted the best the quantity of salt used is the optimum which is requiredbr br although they say serving size  ounce you will finish the whole packet in no time total calories is  for  ounce bag this is slightly on the higher side but still it is ok as they have not compromised on the tastebr br only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips which taste bad kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are therebr br thanks to amazon to get  bags for just  bucks with free shipping using their coupon
533,4,chips are not as tangy as i hoped or expected poore brothers is a better choice for the hardcore salt n vinegar fans
534,3,these bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces also felt very greasy had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin
535,3,the first time i tried these i thought wow but i quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart hard to enjoy the potatochippiness of them when your mouth is under seige
536,2,got these kettle chips sea salt  vinegar  oz bags and was not impressed tasted kind of flat i was eating some out of the bag when i looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed then i started looking at all the unopened bags and many of them had this type same hole some bags had multiple holes one bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it the box they shipped in had no holes so they were packed this way so much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired needless to say ill never be eating anymore kettle products and expect a full refund from kettle or amazonbr m martin
537,5,chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more and using them rather than corn chips to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like janet jackson but without any of the associated wardrobe risks  highly recommended
538,1,when originally produced in england  these were the best chips i had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the us conglomerate they now taste plain nasty hard rather than crispy are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour  a real shame
539,1,after opening numerous bags i found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them completely plain and gross how does this even happen
540,5,i was getting very worried when i read some of the other reviews here  specifically the one star reviews to which i always go to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying itbr br wow  they sure seemed to hate the kettle chips backyard barbecue ounce bags pack of  that i had bought as  ounce bags liked a lot decided to subscribeand then for good measure got  orders of the  ounce bagsbr br yesi love potato chipsespecially these kettle chips backyard barbecue flavourbut others seemed to really hate themor at least hate how they had changedbr but then i realized they were talking about other flavours  amazon in its deep wisdom has obviously seen fit to put all comments concerning all flavours of kettle and other brands of potato chips togetherbr br of course this does have some advantages because most potatochip lovers like me enjoy eating several flavour and brand varieties  so comparisons can be made easily  also as were all potatochip lovers but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing we are here a sort of united nations of potato chip loversall different but all united in our love of potato chips  the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightlyknit but evererexpandinggroup here i think    but  not at first realizing that thesebr different flavour reviews were all together did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum  br br i am happy to report that kettle chips backyard barbeque flavour are totally delicious  at least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the  ounce bags will taste the same  these are definitely chips for adults however  andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips  they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even mebr these backyard barbeque chips by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stonger flavoursbr paprika chili pepper cayenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is less they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweetenersbr br the complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips in the ounce bags and hopefully in the  ounce bags as well is as followsbr br potatoesbr vegetable oil safflower and sunflower oilbr honey powder dried cane sugar honeybr rice powderbr sugarbr saltbr onion powderbr tomato powderbr paprikabr torula yeastbr garlic powderbr chili pepperbr citric acidbr cayenne pepperbr paprika oleoresin colourbr natural smoke flavourbr br naturally cooked natural ingredients  the combination is a true taste treatbr br of course as with all ptato chips moderation is the keybr potatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys  the vegetable oil is great  but too much oil as well as too much starch from the potatoes can hurt the eyes  natural smoke flavour is so yummybut it as well as sugar has  in very large amounts  been linked to cancer productionbr br as far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go thisbr can be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eyes  but as far as the potassium energy  good too much  bad for the kidneys and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too much leading to cancer production  the only thing is to do what is good in everythingm o d e r a t i o nbr br twice or three times a month i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet  i eat only one large bag or the equivalent in small ones of potato chips all day  i supplement this with tea coffee and lemonade as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials i like the dark chocolate flavour  this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks  it also teaches me to eat slowly because that one big bag or many little bags never lasts as long as id like  anyway with excercise and sensible eating the rest of the month and keeping my scale nearby and weighing myself at least twice a day every day ive taken off ten pounds in the last three months  br br these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettlebr are totally scrumptious  except for those jalapino chips which tasted good but were far too spicy for my own taste buds i have yet to meet a potato chip i didnt like to eat  these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips with their combination of potatoes sweetness and spices have truly become one of my top five favouritesif not the very first favourite of allbr br flavoured potato perfection
541,3,these chips are okay  personally i find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange  theyre not necessarily bad but theyre the kind of chip where youre only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty
542,1,ive bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning  keeps you from eating too many  occasionally i get really stale items from amazoncom and this was one  unedible  beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case not expired but stale and unedible just the same
543,4,these chips are very good i couldnt stop eating them they didnt last very longbr br the reason i gave them  stars instead of  is because i think the bags are a little hard to open im not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier
544,1,kettle brand chips used to be so goodoily crunchy flavorful i suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse now theyre no better than any other big name brand chip try the good health kettle style olive oil chips instead they are as good as the kettle brand once was rip kettle brand chips 
545,1,you can absolutely forget about these confirmed by other reviewers these chips are now total garbage like chewing on styrofoam packaging peanuts positively awful no hyperbole or exaggeration ill never buy anything from kettle brand ever again from a reportedly once great premium brand literally any mass market chip ive ever tried tastes better than these stale and rancid tasting and virtually no salty taste whatsoever completely awful
546,1,these chips are nasty  i thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag no the chips were just soaked with grease  nasty
547,2,unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar i doubt you will like these chips  these are the saltiest  sourest chips i have ever had and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because i paid for  full boxes and dont like to waste food  the brown chips are especially bad besides being salty and sour they also taste overcooked and burnt  unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste you will not like these chipsbr br i actually have a high tolerance for sour taste so i can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty  but normal people please do not try this at home
548,1,i bought this brand as a trial since i am tired of the pingosbr br it claims that it is natural i have no argument on this but the point is that more than  in the bag is overfried and in brown color i really suffer eating the overfried chips i open some other bags and it looks like the same so i just throw away all of them i dont know if i was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same but for sure i will never buy this brand any more
549,4,they are good but wish they were also baked have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere if there are any i wish someone would post
550,3,these are better in england i dont know why maybe its just nostalgia on my part
551,1,i ordered kettle chips in the following flavvorsbr salt  fresh ground pepperbr tuscan  cheesebr ny cheddar and hersbr br they all tasted the same to me  if there is a variety pack suggest u order before ordering large sizebr br i wish i could return the unopened bags
552,1,i purchased these because of the low salt and they were indeed low in salt however many many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil i have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands it was very unappetizing and who wants all that oil i will never buy these again and i would not recommend them to others
553,2,if you are looking for strong sv flavor these definitely arent for you very mild in comparison to many others i live in tx and i can tell you ive tried all sv chips i can get ahold of the best of the best are heb storebrand and world market bobs and zapps arent bad from a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch but if youre looking for sv flavor these have just a touch
554,2,i dont know if it was the case of chips we received or what but everyone we allowed to sample the chips in a buffet style setting agreed that these were slightly on the salty sidebr one person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow due to the amount of salt in thesebr br we had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the lays kettle mesquite potato chips but these kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact oppositebr br sorry folks we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty sidebr br we are still looking forward to amazon finally getting the lays kettle mesquite potato chips in stockbr these got a  star because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique
555,1,these chips are greasy and taste burntthere is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it especially at the bottom of the bag even if they are trans fat free they need to be a lot less greasy
556,1,dont waste your money on any of the kettle brand potato chips  i bought a case of these and a case of the cheddar and sour cream  both cases ended up in the garbage can
557,1,defintely not as tasty as the madhouse munchies which are my familys favorite kettles are darkburntmore broken bits taste greasyoily and not the light crunch oh well
558,1,i love sour food but this one i cant bear  too strong sour taste and even when you open the bag the sour smell is too strong  i dont like it
559,1,unless you really really really like vinegar  avoid those chips should have been called vinegar and sea salt  not sea salt and vinegar
560,5,i have loved kettle brand sea salt and vinegar chips since the first time i tried them  the fact that i was able to find them online for such a great price was wonderful  i would definitely make the purchase again  they are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich
561,1,used to eat the spicy thai flavor all the time  msg makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was msg free  now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them  instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage a bunch more salt and msg stuffed in under the label yeast extract  they removed the no msg from the label so they know very well what they didbr br the worst part though is that they taste horrible  instead of crisp oily and full of charactersay as if they were cooked in likea kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays  the spicy thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancidbr br what a shame no more kettle chips for me  it seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method  dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore
562,1,the chips were greatfor the first few bags however after the first bag or two i noticed that the remaining bags were damaged there were holes in each bag and black sticky stains on the outside other reviewers who bought around the same time that i did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chipsbr br the chips came in a sealed kettle box so its hard to say who screwed up but someone somewhere screwed up these chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag now its like a game of roulette
563,1,after waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of  oz bags to arrive upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse  dont know if it is still in the box but it is outside on the porch  when my son gets home im going to have pictures taken and email to amazon  the outside amazon box was intact so it had to be either from the kettle chips people or the amazon warehouse dont know which  i will never buy these again from amazon  i cannot tell you how disgusted i am with this purchase  it makes me sick to think about itbr br i included pictures at the top of the page  poor little mousie must have high cholesterol nowbr br update  i forgot to mention that i offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to amazon but was told they didnt want them
564,5,kettle chips are the best potato chip god has ever invented  i give the lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice a veritable cornucopia of flavor  i have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the spicy thai  sea salt and vinegar flavors alternating days i have already lost  lbs not to mention the myriad of other health benefits i have been experiencing get your life back  with kettle chips
565,5,my daughter that has autism craves hot spice and pungent foods  these are her absolute favorite chips  she calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time  i love the crispy kettle way theyre cooked
566,5,i am a great fan of potato chips and of thai food  i was so happy when kettle chips decided to meld two of my great loves together what a concept  these chips are spicy enough without burning a hole in your tongue  also they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming careful  once in a while this is a treat definitely worth indulging in
567,1,terrible i cannot believe this i received this item and every single bag was opened but  im stationed in afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions i was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box gross and the box is filled with grease stains idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper im very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now
568,5,after reading some of the reviews i got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst no worries here all bags are in great shape and expiration dates arent until june chips at least from the first bag taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world by the way fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so yay team
569,1,kettle branch potato chips new york cheddar  these are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty on the burnt side and taste rancid either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old  i want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then  but after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips these just dont hit the spot for me
570,5,i am glad i was able to find these on this site i love this flavor and they are so crunchy the box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs most of the bags survived in tact
571,5,these chips taste awesome and unlike most other flavored chips they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip just dont pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption theyll totally know it was you
572,5,with kettle chips you really have to be careful  some of their flavors are nauseating  with that said they do make fantastic plain chips  thick cuts of potato fried to a dark golden brown  they are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt  i cant recommend these chips enough  you wont regret itbr br some people say they are burnt but they arent  from their website take a quick look and youll see an immediate difference kettle brandâ® potato chips are a beautiful tawny gold during cooking the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize creating chips from light gold to a deep amber  the results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors and an artisanal display in every bagbr br some have also said that these chips are oily which is true  but they explain that on their website at kettle foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower andor safflower oil to make kettle brandâ®  products both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way we have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are trans fat free meaning none were detected you will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging  that oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being usedbr br you will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor  im also a fan of their unsalted potato chips  for those of us watching our salt intake the unsalted chips is the best you can get  period
573,5,these are among the best chips i have ever eaten  i first came upon them when i visited a costplus world market store in opelika al in the tiger town mall in   i wasnt a big fan of dijonflavored anything but i decided to give these chips a try  i was hooked  i probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months time  i searched all over my part of alabama the northwestern part of the state and could not find them  i later tried to find them at the world market in hoover at the patton creek shopping center and they did not carry this flavor  however when i learned that they were available on amazoncom and also available for prime shipping  i bought them as soon as i read kettle chips honey dijon ounce bags pack of br br you get a pretty big box filled with  bags of these delicious morsels  they last quite a while but i will reorder very very soon  i suggest you buy them in this bulk form and enjoy them  you wont be disappointed  they go great with hamburgers and hot dogs  so theyre perfect for spring and this coming summers outdoor activities and cookoutsbr br take my word for it these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods  buy some today and fall in love like me
574,5,i have never been addicted to anything in my lifeuntil i tasted these chips  i have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same  youve got to stick with this blue bag of chips
575,5,im addicted to salty and tangy flavors so when i opened my first bag of sea salt  vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgmbvkettle chips honey dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgqgmkettle chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly
576,5,i bought these when on sale through amazon  nice crispy thick chips  definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale
577,1,for those of you who like me had to order the kettle spicy thai chips from amazon because they are so hard to find locally you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed  they are just like regular potatoe chips  i paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didnt like the spicy thai but these are fine for himbr br yuck
578,5,ive found a new taste treat im not a big one for potato chips so i am sure ive come late to discover these i think they are really good  the processing  ingredients list is actually pretty goodno trans fats etc so if you want an indulgence these are a   they are thicker  more tasty than the mass produced potato chips weve all come to know  they are much more flavorful  never had a honeydijon potato chip before incredibly good  a flavorful combination of sweet tangy salty also not overly hot or spicy excellentbr br if you want a snack have something really good its got to be worth the caloriesand these are
579,5,this is a real good producti love these chips and so does my customers cant go wrong wit these the best
580,5,i love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them these are the only chips i eat
581,4,i dont know what to say that others have not covered if you like potato chips you will like these get em on sale when you can and limit your intakeif you can
582,5,if youre looking at this you probably already know you like these chipsbr this is a great deal and i have not had any problems with them going stalebr the oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid overeating
583,1,while i admit that the oversalted chip is addictive i really think this one has gone too far skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these i am surprised that they are still on the market
584,5,only mg sodium per serving chips are crisp  i sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor
585,5,i have found this product kettle chips unsalted to be fabulous  i found them by accident on amazon after hunting all over my local stores  they are crisp and tasty without all of the salt
586,4,when i saw the spicy thai chips i knew i had to try them i love spicy and i love thai food so why not first off these chips are not super spicy they actually taste sort of sweet at first with many degrees of flavor the spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards id say these are definitely a good unique chip but if you absolutely hate sweet chips id try a different flavor since these are a little sweet
587,5,smiles thank you lord for i have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted and tastes great i almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this the only thing i would ask kettle to change is the texture its slightly hardcrunchy but not a problem at all i would just prefer it to be softer kettle if you do make that happen please keep everything else the same thank you
588,5,these are my favorite but they arent for everybody in a way they sort of taste like oriental flavor ramen but with a kick for me how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger they are a bit rich so they arent for everydayforamonth snacking because this is a case purchase i recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case the oz size seems to be no longer available which is a shame i can eat the entire oz bag
589,5,salt  vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so i think ive tried every brand out there  these are by far the best  i also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy  they seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste
590,5,package arrived double boxed wrapped and the inside boxthat holds the goods perfect not a single dent or rough mark outstanding packagingbr br the productbr br these are the best chips on the planet salt n vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips ive ever had you might actually im sure you probably wont like it at first bite if you have never had these before but try it againbr br not to mention this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures
591,5,if you love jalapeno chips then kettle is a must trybr nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapenobr deliciousbr addictingbr recommended
592,4,my son bought a package of the jalapeno potato chips a couple weeks ago and he and i have become addictedbr br first kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc than many other chips as one peruses the dietary informationbr br second individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at thembr br third the jalapeno has some kick not overly hot of course too many products labelled as spicy are not have no kick and are as bland as can be here you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno my preference a bit more heat but i understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than i would still decent spicynessbr br all in all i have been pretty happy with this product in the few weeks since we first bought it i now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store   
593,5,after looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box i had to write a review  i have bought these chips numerous times from amazon warehouse deals and each time they came packaged perfectly  there was a sale at the end of the summer and i received a few casesboxes for just over   the chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag  i hid them in the garage and only remembered them when i went out there that way i didnt eat them all  as far as the pictures if the person contacted amazon he made out ok  amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called amazon  thanks for a great tasting product good price and quick shipping  ill buy these againsoon
594,2,there is nothing too good or too bad about these chips if you like plain potato chips youd like these they are thicker than most brands fresh out of box very crunchy and not too salty for me one bag has a lot i generally cannot finish it by myself part of the reason is that they are too oily some chips almost look transparent if you know what i mean the taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me if you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice except salt as the name says i dont think ill buy these again the best by date on my bags are march  and i ordered them at the end of october
595,3,i love this sea salt  vinegar flavor from kettle  when i saw this one on the daily deal here for case i put my order without doubt  however when i received the case i found out that the whole case is expiring in december while i got it at the end of august  i tried one package and i can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips  i was disappointed and then i found out this item is not returnable  how convenient  although i love this chips i wont order from here again with the concern of close expiration date
596,5,this is the second purchase of kettle potato chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them we bought them by the a carton of  bags the kettle chips were in a oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal the chips are so delicious baked not fried and lightly salted with sea salt they have  fat no preservatives nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients what more could you ask for in a great tasting chip
597,5,how to achieve potato chip nirvana its simple  buy these chips get them tomorrow eat thembr repeatbr br whybr br best old school bbq flavor out therebr kettle qualitybr incredible price with amazonbr br did i mention delicious and a terrific bargain
598,5,i found these more than  years ago in a health food store after i bought one bag i found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips the new york cheddar flavor is so good you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag
599,5,but you will enjoy ever step i gained  lbs within a month of buying this  pack of full sized bags damn it they should warn you about this tastes awesome though when i finish my crash diet i will order another box case 
600,5,these are the best spicy chips i have ever had the pleasure of eating  they start off sweet then as you eat more the spice builds up  they are fantastic  if you dont want to commit to a whole case pick up a bag at your local whole foods first then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are  got my case right here and loving every bite  on a side note this brand kettle brand has many delicious varieties this is just my personal favorite  i also highly recommend backyard bbq honey dijon sweet onion buffalo bleu salt and pepper and death valley chipotle  lays aint got nothin on kettle brand
601,5,ive eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and theyve always been terrible  i didnt expect much when i bought these  but after i tasted them i was amazed  i have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these  they have a natural potato flavor with thick crunchy chips  the only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open  use scissors and save yourself the aggravation
602,5,kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips ive tasted thus far they are thick has a bite to them and i love their creative flavors my favorite kettle chip happens to be the honey dijon i think its a great combination sweet salty and tangy perfect for one of those snack attacks when you dont know exactly what you want i especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch these oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions like me
603,5,as an oregonian i make a point of sharing these oregonmade snacks with friends who visit the state i tell them the kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with spicy thai chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectlybr br i also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgmbvkettle chips honey dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgmbuakettle chips sea salt  vinegarabr br the honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty tangy sweet and crunchy other brands ive tried use too much mustard flavor which overpowers the honey dijon pairing the honey dijon chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally they also go down great with beerbr br the sea salt  vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br in summary i highly recommend kettle brand chips a great buy on amazoncom
604,5,im addicted to salty and tangy flavors so when i opened my first bag of sea salt  vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgmbvkettle chips honey dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgqgmkettle chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly
605,5,kettle chips are thicker and crunchier though greasier at times than other chips and the honey dijon flavor is great  they dont have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have and the oz size is great for an adult size snack
606,5,ive always liked salt and vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag not with these the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until youve finished the bag these are very addictive if you like salt and vinegar these are the ultimate chips nothing else compares
607,5,tasted good spicy those that dont like spicy should stay away from this for the price paid very good buy
608,4,these are seriously delicious especially if you like plain potato chips my only concern is theyre very oily i understand theyre kettle chips and theyre fried small batches and all but when you open the bag thats another thing very strong bag need scissors theres a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves i suggest a blotshake on some paper towels before consuming either way they have a yummy potato taste and very satisfying crunch delicious
609,5,this bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool such as scissors dont even try without scissorsbr br they are crispy and taste like chips that arent advertised as being salted they definitely arent healthy because i can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them and i can see the grease at the bottom of the bag toobr br they are highquality chips and deserve to be put on your table
610,5,kettle foods inc makes the best tasting potato chips ive ever eaten  with a variety of flavors from classic barbeque to their unique spicy thai youll find the right flavor for your mouth and not only do they taste wonderful but these allnatural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterolbr br but why is it a gogreenmartmore product of the week kettle foods inc is a green giant a company highlighted for their environmental practices  they convert waste oils to biodiesel to power some of their company cars a rooftop solar panel system creates kwh annually for production and they offset  of their additional us energy usage by buying renewable energy credits not only are their efforts for the future but they care for the present by rejuvenate a neighboring  acre wetland ecosystem and during recent building construction they earned a gold rating from leadership in energy and environmental design leedbr br now your mouth will thank you and so will the environment
611,5,these really are amazing chips dont be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheeseit is so subtle that even blue cheese haters like mewill enjoy these
612,4,these chips are delectably delicious i am on a low sodium diet i didnt have to give up totally something that i truely love to snack these chips are bursting with flavor and you cant really tell they are missing all that salt there is just a kiss worth on a chip but beleive me it is a total makeout
613,5,not too salty like regular supermarket chips this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt when you just gotta have some chips kettle chips lightly salted chips are the what youve been searching forbr br theres no cholesterol no trans fats no artificial anything  and because of the manufacturing process they actually seem to have kind of a homemade qualitybr br this is an excellent product
614,5,i agree with the company motto a natural obsession  i tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about  percent  the flavor of these is very strong so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread  otherwise they compete or clash with the other food
615,5,the new york cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the kettle brand potato chips these are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy unfortunately it may do the opposite to your backside so dont do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroombr br i still give it a  of  starsbr br also the online price at amazon is better than anywhere else ive seen them combined with amazon prime youll be getting a great deal on these chips
616,4,these are my new favorite  i have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one  they do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like thesebr br price wisei do not see that they are that much of a deal here  i purchased them for  at the grocery with no shipping  i would have given the product  stars easily had it not been for the price  the taste is fabulous  you wont be disappointed
617,5,these chips were good i ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good i am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do
618,5,these are the best chips out there nothing can beat this taste if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this once you eat it you wont stopaddicting stuff
619,3,i dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did i checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me 
620,5,at first i was thinking cheese flavored chips  but i love them  the herbs they used are just delicious  the cheese is not overpowering  they are yummy and crispy
621,2,the spicy thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market  however kettle foods has changed the ingredients used with ginger  being the most important that is now missing  notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag  sadly the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me  they arent that good anymore and the spice level is virtually nonexistentbr br here are the original and new ingredient listingsbr br original ingredientsbr select potatoes safflower andor sunflower oil honey powder evaporated cane syrup honeysalt garlic powder jalapeno pepper ground ginger onion powder habanero pepper dried parsley citric acid cilantro extract ginger oil cayenne pepper white pepper lime oilbr br new ingredientsbr potatoes safflower andor sunflower oil sugar dried cane syrup salt maltodextrin yeast extract spices garlic powder onion powder dried parsley jalapeno powder citric acid natural flavors lime extractbr br im assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner  blue diamond  they might want to get rid of  great taste naturally from their bags as i dont consider maltodextrin to be very naturalbr br great job kettle  way to ruin a great thing
622,1,i was sent  week past fresh by date stock chips are noticeably not fresh in taste wont order againbr br edit and just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat unfortunately i put a chip in my mouth before i saw the holebr br very bad form amazon
623,5,i try to be good but when i feel like indulging in some delicious gourmet potato chips these new york chedder potato chips are the first flavor i like to go for when i see them at the natural food store  the chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand
624,1,and that is  the problem i order these by the case of   and when they are good which is over half the time they are the best kettle chip the best and then i get a case of the worse  the potatos are mealy and old so i just throw them out and order again expensive but when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best  the last case is what prompted me to write this  the potatos were weird  like they were almost sour as in going bad  and i even wrote the company that makes them  so if you want the best kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are not the best try againbr i myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring
625,4,i got the sea salt and vinegar chips from kettle  i am used to the salt and vinegar chips in the white bag if i am allowed to say that  anyways my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price  i got the  z x  bags and wow it is so many for the price  you can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging also  well being used to the cheaper chips i wasnt expecting how mellow these things are  the ones i am used to have a really sour taste to them which i didnt mind but they had tons of flavor  these chips dont have any sour to them at all and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste  if you want to try out salt and vinegar chips i suggest you try these out first  so for the price and how many you get these chips are definately worth it  they are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants  i recommend these  stars
626,5,weve long enjoyed this brand of chip so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find thesebr br   granted i bought them somewhat reluctantly because im a confirmed saltaholic generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans  i was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to bootbr br   how nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt
627,4,for those who love salt and vinegar potato chips this is the one to choose the flavor is zippy and tart with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less natural versions of this snack the ounce bags are just right to share at lunch the chips are a little greasy and thats why ive given them  stars instead of 
628,5,kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market i dont care for the fancy flavors and these are salted just right thick super crunchy and full of flavor they are the best
629,3,these chips are tasty but not what i expected from a low salt item  they seem as salty as any regular potato chip and they also seem excessively greasy  by comparison cape cod reduced fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy
630,5,fantastic tasting potato chips i love the individual bags great for kids and adults too no trans fat no cholesterol no artifical stuffbr low in sodium and high in potassium which is great for people like me with hbpbr only problem is amazon is out of stock some times and price is high
631,4,the chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips the bags are very strong  much thicker than say lays potato chip bags inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips salted just right because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion some are cooked more than others which gives it a more authentic nonmanufactured feel some people may not like thatbr br i reccomend them
632,5,my  yo is a kettle chip addict so i was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch great quality and much cheaper than in the stores will definitely be buying more
633,3,yes they are good however they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff which is initially satisfying then becomes too much and certainly isnt good for the waistline or general nutritional issuesbr br and the package cant be opened without a sharp implement i couldnt pull it apart at the top as i am used to doing i dont normally carry a knife or scissors and dont have rodent teeth well i was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key even then the bag was wow thick and toughbr br on the package it says these are krinkle cut chips turns out that means the corrugated kind not what i wanted i dont eat rippleridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth so this information is importantbr br these are good but so are other brands with which i dont have these problems
634,5,this may sound rediculous but i actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when i ordered these kettlebrand jalapeno chips  at the time i placed my order i couldnt remember the name of the jalapeno chips that i had recently discovered and liked and the kettlebrand chips were packaged in a similarlycolored bag  but it all worked out for the best because i do really like the kettlebrand of jalapeno chips and will happily munch away on them during upcoming tv football games  when i run out probably sometime next year i will likey purchase miss vicky brand of jalapeno chips and i plan to try the other flavors of kettlebrand chips  imho kettlebrand chips are excellent and i recommend them to all potato chip affectionadosbr br sincerelybr br   â§ homiedog â§
635,3,miss vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available  im not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and miss vickies are better imho
636,3,i want to like kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil which are both gmo and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy but darnit these things bite back on the plus side the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many on the minus side a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it do they have to be so hard and crunchy whats wrong with simply light and crispy i vastly prefer lays texture but suffer with kettle due to the absense of gmos and cornsoy i wish theyd come out with something less harsh on the mouth though
637,4,i think these chips are awesome if not the best along with poor brothers salt and vinager chips but if you buy these spicy thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor at the bottom of the bag in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time i bought these off amazon but that was like in  so i would suggest trying spicy thai in a bag bigger then  ounces
638,4,this kettle chips taste good  crispy  crunchy  too  u will enjoy it also moreoverits thinly cut  sliced
639,5,i knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips  the price per bag cant be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated
640,5,this is a delicious teabr br im just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff i like and earl grey is amongst the top especially with bergamotbr br the problem i find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little or too muchbr br this one is perfect i really like the balance in the flavor i dont add anything to this tea just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in  minutes its readybr br tastes like an expensive tea but priced like lipton definitely recommend it for fans of earl grey with a kick
641,5,i bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey teavana black teas i have a cup every morning very smooth refreshing tea
642,5,the tea tin is guarding the aroma very wellbr the taste is beautiful the malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just rightbr the first time i used too much tea and soaked it for too long i used as reference darjeeling ftgfop first flushbr since then i save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutesbr a delight the best earl grey i ever had the price is very competitive
643,5,prosbr  extremely fragrantbr  full bodiedbr  can be steeped twicebr  nice airtight containerbr  organicbr br consbr  pricebr br the tao of tea blue flower earl grey black tea is the best earl grey i have ever tasted and i would recommend it to anyonebr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeppfgothe tao of tea blue flower earl grey black tea loose leaf ounce tins pack of a
644,5,after a lifetime of tea drinking i can honestly say that this is the best earl grey i have ever tasted  i have ordered it a number of times and each batch is consistently excellent i have even given it as a gift as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh  the metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up  do yourself a favor if you like earl grey and treat yourself to this tea
645,5,these biscuits are delicious not too sweet with just enough crunch  we love them  quick delivery we would order them again  very satisfied
646,5,excellent lofat lo calorie treat for dogs i have a german shorthair pointerand these treats are her favorite the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs but she loves themand for weightcontrol i like them
647,5,my male maltese dog had been enjoying the old roys puppy biscuits from walmart  then i couldnt find them  i was desperate to find a treat that would measure up  i ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingersbr br they arrived and my little guy loves them  he gets one heartshaped biscuit at bedtime  he sleeps in a crate  when he hears me touch the bag of treats he beats a path to his crate in high excitement  they are a big hit with my him  they are well worth the price  they are high quality and i can even smell peanuts in them
648,5,this product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys  it has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure
649,5,love this with a bag of shrimp  pound some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped not too hot but very tasty
650,4,so i got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle it tasted like smoky flavored milk  yuck i was depressed i was stuck with  bottles of this  it sat on my shelf and i forgot about it last weekend i tasted a zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor it tasted weird and smokey like the lorann oil i had gotten  i tried to doctor up the soda with a little sf vanilla torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream  it tasted amazing  the odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeelbr br so i wanted to see if this would help the lorann oil too  i put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it it tasted fine  then i added one drop of the oil it is very strong and stirred it in  it tasted so much better  i whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treatbr br now i will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream  it was such a happy accident to find out how to use it  when added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in creambr br it is very potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch
651,5,we make up a coffee creamer with  part commercial coffee creamer vanilla butter creme almond and bavarian creme flavors and the rest milk  it tastes wonderful and is half the price of storeboughtbr br it is excellent
652,5,im from detroit and i was raised on vernors ginger ale  once i moved to california though i found it difficult to find vernors  it would pop up here and there and then disappear  i guess without advertising it just never found a homebr br i prefer the plastic bottles but the ideal size is the  oz  ml or the one liter  the problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person me too long to drink it letting it go flatbr br in any case vernors is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years i think  that imparts a great unique flavorbr br i wish it would catch on again and become available more widelybr br recently i did see it on sale in redwood city in californias bay area south of san francisco  the next day it was gone
653,5,i like vernors and drink it all the time it is old fashioned drink from michigan since  and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character if you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste vernors has a strong vanilla presence is smoother and more moist and sweeter than a ginger ale it is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale very good a ginger ale is more dry higher in carbonation and has a spicier bite to it vernors has  grams sugar per can versus  grams per can for schweppes ginger ale neither has caffeinebr br the recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners they use the same high fructose corn syrup that the costcutting mega soda companies use rather than the cane sugar they used to use the down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors many microbrews are using cane sugar again although it costs more to get a better taste vernors is still aged in oak barrels for  years no doubt accounting for the smoothness all in all a great soda for anytime the soda is also known like other ginger drinks for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomachbr vernors is a regional soda and there are many areas of the country you cant find it in that is why it sells here they may be selling it in glass bottles again soon at least there is a page that says so the day i am writing this comment search at amazon for asin bjkseg to see what i mean vernors has quite a history and there are two books at amazon about the soda the first is vernors ginger ale images of america michigan isbn  the second book is the vernors story from gnomes to now isbn  a book about the companys marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome and vernors fans
654,5,if you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup barley malt or brown rice syrup this will do nicely i use madhavas agave nectar in my baked goods all the time and am always pleased with the results at the time im writing this amazon was out of stock as a vendor however when it was in stock it was priced well for the packbr br other than baking ive used it to top waffles pancakes and in small doses  teaspoon added it to oatmeal a little goes a long waybr br using agave nectar use  to  less agave nectar than you would another sweetener depending on your taste and the recipe recipes with dried fruit need much less cut the heat in the oven by  degrees f if there is oil in the recipe cut it by  alternately use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid  just dont use too much or your recipe will be dry additionally when baking make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry most bakers might already know this but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients unless beaten with butter firstbr br agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do so you wont be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy however i highly recommend it for baking it makes everything moisterbr br if you are looking for less caramel flavor youll need to use the light version of this product equally good in all applications
655,4,good quality nectar  very tastybr br however i was expecting  fluid ounces not  ounces in weightbr br i find that  ounces in weight makes about  fluid ounces
656,5,first time ive ever used agave nectar  and it is great  keeps the blood sugar stable  great buy also
657,5,this sweetner is the best it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to and it has great health benefts
658,5,i love this stuff  it sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels  now if i could only figure out how to make tequila i would be set  just kidding
659,5,i finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index agave is delicious i have recommended it to many friends and it is very economical to purchase the oz bottles
660,4,i used to buy the wholesome sweetners agave and like it a little better but switched because it became too expensive so this is the cheeper option the taste is the same but it seems a little less sweet because i find i have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee i dont like the container it doesnt pour well so i have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle so that i dont have a sticky mess on my counter every day its fine for the price i continue to have it shipped to me every other month
661,5,i love using this to sweeten tea coffee etc it tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners  there is no bitter aftertaste
662,5,i ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product  it works great for cooking baking and as a substitute sugar in my chai lattes
663,5,i really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea and i have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and agave nectar
664,4,we have been using day diet guided by lowglycemic eating for about  months with fair success this amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar the taste is mellowand the sweetening power is higher than sugar so you use less but without the twang of honey the one thing i have not tried it on still using sugar is making kombucha  i still use sugar as im not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha but actually that may just be my own overcaution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstancebr br our primary uses are sweetening yogurt using it in the little baking i do and use in salad dressings fruit desserts etc because we are limiting our sweets consumptionwe dont use a lot of this but its nice to have when we need it i plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season i buy it on subscription and the cost is about  less than the local walmart and more than  less than the health food store on this same brand best by date on the bottles i received in may is 
665,5,i am so glad i was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar this is so much better i really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too learning how to use it what the first thing i had to learn once i learned how to use it i became hooked i would not even look at sugar any more i highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foodsif you do purchase this sweetner take advantage of ship and save it will save you lots of money in the long run
666,5,i love this product it is the best natural sweetener i have ever tried and i have tried many you can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich it last a long time and is a good value
667,5,i have been using agave nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home madhava agave nectar is good tasting it was a good buy
668,5,this stuff is great because its low glycemic substitute this to sugar and youll be doing your body a great favor  this size is economical and shipping is fast too  i got mine very soon
669,5,save a little money buying in larger quantities as opposed to the smaller bottles i like the taste of agave cross between honeymaple good for pies cereal frozen yogurt etc
670,5,this is an awesome product which ive ordered many times  honeylike flavored lower glycemic sweetener thats great in coffee or tea
671,5,thank you for this product  we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent  thanks again
672,5,i am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels my nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since its gi index is in the low s as opposed to honey in the low s and sugar in the mids ive tried supermarkets health food stores and wholesale clubs the prices are usually around  for a oz bottle and this is ish for xoz its used like honey  substitute c for every c sugar and reduce liquids by thbr br i also use it in a carrot cake recipe equal substitution instead of sugar where i substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and i dont decrease the other liquids its delicious and youd never know thats its actually good for you
673,1,i am very disappointed with this product because i could not see how many calories it has at the time i ordered it i received it and now i can see it has  calories per tablespoon granulated sugar has only  calories per tablespoon how could agave nectar be better than sugar
674,5,i was out to dinner with friends  family at the saloon in rte  entertainment complex in sanford fl besides having an awesome staff ask for keith and fabulous food the escargot is a must they serve china mist tea this is the st time i chose the tropical organic green  i have no doubt it is the best flavored tea i have ever had
675,5,if youve tried the conventional kettle crinkle chip verson salt and peper you cant compare these to those  these are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat but oompletely enjoyable  you finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices  great stuff
676,5,these are the best tasting tortilla chips i have ever had  i have become allergic to tomatoes but i love tortilla chips  there is so much flavor in these chips that i no longer miss pico de gallo i prefer to eat them plain they also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful but not overpoweringly spicy
677,5,these potato chips are delicious  i have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips  amazon lowered the price on these and i finally had a chance to order them  i most definitely will be ordering them again  my family and i love them  they are pure and void of all artificial flavorings  the true flavor is present and it satisifies the need for something salty sweet spicy and crunchy  a
678,4,these chips are a great snack if you dont want all the junk assiciated with chips  try them youll like them
679,4,i love these chips the flavor is not plain they are sweet and spicy all at the same time  the only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt but it still a great flavor
680,5,thesedont like hot food they might be a bit much for you they have a great balance of sweetness and spice of course kettle chips are just good chips  they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty i also like that they are ridged chips  those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me  i dont want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness if you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips
681,5,just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet very hard to find in new jersey can not have just one bag around
682,5,i cant believe how wonderful this chip is the slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor my family and i are offically addicted
683,4,these chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa the texture is brittle and thin like other plockys chipsbr br the only downside the spice is minimal
684,4,i think plockys brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but i found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy
685,5,these are the best chips i have ever eaten everyone in our family loves them sweet but spicy crispyreally good delivery was perfect no crushed chips fantastic overall
686,5,a nice case of chips that are quite tasty i definitely enjoy the kettle sea salt and black pepper i just wish they were bigger bags 
687,5,i ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service oh my word spicy but not burning spicy more like tonguewarming sweetish saltya really stronglyflavored and delicious chip if you like barbecue flavor this is a nice sweetmexified barecuebr br i also like that its organicbr br i ate the  oz bag in less than  minutes my bad but dang if theyre not sinfully deliciousbr br granted oz is not a whole lot it was skimpy for the price which is often the case when it comes to organic but it was  calories at a pop geeshbr br yes  cals per  oz serving thats about par for the course for fried chipsbr br verdict fattening crispy flavorful delicious best to stick to very small servings on the side of a lowfat sandwich or soupbr br enjoybr br mir
688,5,at first you think that these chips arent all that spicy but the spice will grow on you with each bite  they are really very good
689,5,i cant say enough good things about plockys chips  i have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgwkogplockys tortilla chips black beans n rice ounce bags pack of a and i love them  they taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying  i have never eaten a tortilla chip that didnt make me feel guilty afterwards  not with plockysi always eat less and feel satisfied  i actually prefer these eaten by themselvesno dipsand i keep a bag in my desk at work  i have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something  i bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too  i am a fan of plockys chips and will continue to purchase them on amazon
690,5,my aunt gave me a bag of these and i was immediately addicted there are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips i love the zip agreed they are awesome without salsa and no trans fat
691,1,i was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued kettle flavor but was disappointed when i opened the box and found this substitution i am keeping them but would not have ordered  bags of this flavor it is a very good bbq chip but i could get this flavor at the grocery store why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued the one star is for the substitution the country bbq is a  start chip but not the chip i longed for
692,5,we love these chips they can be eaten alone since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip every one that we have introduced the chips to loves them and the expiration date is for  months from now so ordering  bags didnt come near to them going stale
693,5,i bought these chips and wanted to try if they were tasty it sure is  unique and different flavor and the right thicknessbr br it remains crunchy spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat there are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips however some of the spices are lacking from this chip but i liked this very muchbr br i would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips go ahead you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese  maybe some el pastor shredded meat tomatoes etcetera
694,5,i love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture used to get them at henrys in san diego ca before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from amazon since running out of them constantly
695,4,these chips are the only ones i found to be tasty and healthy they have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutritionthe perfect blend
696,5,we love these cant always get them in local stores they dont keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out strong enough to dip in any condiment great flavor and grain texture
697,4,these spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards the first time i ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing i could taste them in my mouth the next morning so just be careful about when you eat them especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day
698,5,the first time i ate these chips was in aruba in   i couldnt find them in our area ct so you can imagine my joy when i found them on amazon  i love these and hope you continue to carry them  your prices are terrific too  i pay  in aruba and they run about  a bag when i buy the case of  through amazon  good job  only problem is now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in but thats oksharing is good
699,5,these chips are delicious if you like salt  pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch then you cant go wrong with thesethey are the tastiest bag ive come across the sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt in fact i have trouble cutting myself off midbag even though i normally enjoy a low sodium diet i would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the oz bags
700,5,i used to buy these at the local supermarket but they are no longer carried there  finding them on amazon i purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as i remembered  for chips they are also very healthy  i definately will buy them again
701,5,plockys red beans and rice tortilla chips are really tasty i shared a few bags with my daughter in iraq she said ummm they are good they are good for you too no artificial stuff
702,5,we like plockysbr they like usbr plockys plockysbr mean no fussbr taste so goodbr and healthy toobr plockys plockysbr grab a bag or twobr thank you plockys
703,5,i love these potato chip they r soooo good  sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness i will be ordering these again soon love it
704,5,the best potato chips ive ever had at the best price ive ever paid the service was respectable and the shipping free
705,5,i love this product  all of the different flavors are fantastic  my family likes the  grain the best  no more corn tortilla chips in this house
706,5,love these chips and i dont even like black beans  very tasty  yum  plus good for you
707,5,these chips are fanfreakintastic they are with out a doubt the best chips that i have ever had a nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bitoheat oh ya baby
708,5,nice amount of heat and smoke very tasty chip that goes great with a brew
709,5,these chips are salty with a hint of sweet they are crisp and crunchy they are the best chips ive ever had
710,5,we ordered these only because the black beans and ricewhich we really really love was out of stock  after about a week we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier  there is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort  we took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag  i used them from another bag as a garnish on a salad that i took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowlbr we will definitely order these againa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgwluguplockys tortilla chips red beans n rice ounce bags pack of a
711,5,i was first introduced to the red rice  beans chips in my hometown of bethlehem pa  when i moved to north carolina i was unable to find these chips in my local area  on my trips back home i would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to nc  then i discovered that i could order them online and life was great  these chips are my all time favorite and everyone that i serve them to loves them just the same  you just gotta try them  youll be hooked    nancy walsh
712,5,ok if you dont want to get addicted dont try plockys red beans and rice tortilla chips my husband and i started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store now weve just received our second case it wont last long beware
713,5,my husband who being mexican is very picky about his tortilla chips and i absolutely love these  the texture is light and crispy rather than thick and crunchy he actually usually prefers a very hearty cruncy chip like el ranchero but the flavor of these is so fantastic that were both thilled with them the bean rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that we go through an embarrassing amount of them  i never ever like plain chips but these i can eat without anything else although theyre particularly amazing with a fresh salsa  i highly recommend these
714,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgwluguplockys tortilla chips red beans n rice  ounce bag pack of a  i first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in ky  they are not available where i live so i ordered them from amazon  wow  my friends and family are all addicted to them  the spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite  once a bag is open it is gone
715,5,we like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market they are even great by themselves we will order these as long as they are available thank you for making them accessablebr br   shelly kenyon
716,2,i guess theres no telling what will tickle the palate  im a huge tabasco fan and i love unconventional snacks  but these dont taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce theyre made from i didnt find them to have much of a kick at all  practically bland in fact  even with my strong aversion to wasting food i had to throw out or give away most of the case  do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 
717,1,yeast extract is listed as an ingredient sounds harmless right specifically these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract which is on a chemical level monosodium glutamate its just derived from a different source but it has all the same toxic properties kettle still advertises their products as containing no msg while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with msg sensitivities
718,3,these were not flavorful enough for my taste it seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag too bad because i really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip i would not buy these again
719,5,plockys chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness  they are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips  the flavor out performs any tortilla chip i have ever eaten  they hold up great to salsas and dips  nothing wimpy about them  i just wish the company made a bigger bag  love them  usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty  order by the case  youll be glad you did as they disappear fast
720,4,i love these chips and ordered them after i had some in florida  my case of chips came without any packing inside  all bags in a box with no cushioning at all  needless to say most of the chips were broken and i would not order them again  a great item but if they cant package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money
721,5,i received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them i searched high and low but was unable to find them until i saw them here i immediately ordered a case these chips are light crispy flavorful and good for you i love them with dip in chili or just plain once you try them youll be hooked
722,5,these chips are truly amazing they have it all theyre light crisp great tasting nice texture and theyre all natural and low in fat and sodium need i say more i recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store and couldnt belive my taste buds thats why i excited why i saw them here on amazon and decided to buy a case
723,5,these are the most fantastic chips ive ever had  i could eat the whole bag myself  theyre made with lots of whole grain and beans and make a complete protein so i have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks  they are great  the only problem i have with them  the bag is too small  we need a bigger bag 
724,2,i did not like these potatoe chips its hot and sweet with an overwhelming taste of garlic its also a bit salty
725,5,they did a very good job with shipping the order quicklynothing like ace hardware who took a week to ship
726,2,long story short  these are very tasty we have purchased a number of flavors from this brand this is my favoritebr br but as noted by another reviewer  these contain msg in the form of yeast extractbr br it has become a popular means of hiding msg lately by calling it different things as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what i consume i find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersomebr br also the bag is not very large but half of it is air this may well help in shipping but when paying a premium price for organic it just seems more deceptive
727,5,wonderful candy hard to find  i got a huge bag and put it in freezer  it came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic just great
728,4,i bought this for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else
729,5,so surprised to find the taiwanshaped pineapple cakes they are so cutebr ive never found any pineapple cake like this at our local asian supermarkets so i ordered some from here these lovely pastries made our dragon boat festival party much more fun my friends and i think it is a good idea to  order them again for our midautumn festival party
730,4,i really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here unlike some of the massproduction pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring tasselfields pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference you can even taste the fibers from pineapplebr br i opted for the traditional pineapple this time i will be interested in trying out the longan or mango variety next time
731,5,i purchased this  pack of big ass soda and only got  immediately i was all like oh man this is gonna suck regardless of the quantity error though it sure kicked some redbr br everyone in my town absolutely loves it i highly recommend along with other soda voltagesbr br malcom
732,5,well being the big red fan that i am i bought some of this first of all let me tell you the price is amazing i mean where else can you get this type of deal in saudi arabia everyone in village loved it of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it
733,3,expiration date  smashed and stale edible not real enjoyable for the price i paid one of the best pretzels i had whenbr i purchased them from publix they stopped carrying them i must find another addiction
734,5,this cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor  its moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isnt terribly bad for your diet  its delicious
735,1,unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously i neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since i was then receiving free shipping had  delivered we that is my husband guests and meknew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed but currently amazon featured the supreme babka and now i am awaiting to receive these in the future i will read more carefully
736,1,i opened the can and immediately became concerned when i saw what looked like dried white crust rather than fluffy frosting  the package recommended stirring before use so i gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo  the best i can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in better of dead no raisins in it thoughbr i tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it  when lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knifebr i opted for making my own frosting instead  very easy  a little sprectrum palm shortening a lot of powdered sugar a tiny splash of vanilla a tiny bit of salt and rice milk as needed for consistency beat for  minutes and i had the fluffy butter cream frosting i thought id get from cherrybrookbr br i wonder if our can was overheated in the store whole foods or somethingbr ive read positive reviews of their frosting mix so maybe ill try that next time
737,2,well i opened it and it is grayish sticky mess im so mad at myself for wasting my money and not trying to make it from scratch at home which would probably end up better and cheaper oh well live and learn
738,1,i love cherrybrook kitchen and have tried almost all of their products  i was excited to try the ready to spread frosting as i do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting  i am not a picky eater especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible  the consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting  it is not light and fluffy  it is very gooey  i cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake  it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey  i did not even try it on a cake because the taste and texture were so offputting  seriously do not waste your money
739,1,this product was such a disappointment  as all the other reviewers said its a gluey sticky texture more akin to elmers glue than to an edible food product  the flavor was sickening sweet  i actually thought that the frosting had spoiled  it was that bad  save yourself the time and  i paid  and make your own frosting or go with another brand  cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good  its hard to believe they even sell this
740,1,i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for c the taste was not bad but no way i could frost my cake it stuck to the kniferan down in stringswhat a mess i too thought i had gotten a bad batchmy gds birthday cake looks like crap who would buy this mess horrible
741,1,i recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now i know why it was on salebr br this is not a fluffy creamy white frosting youd expect to find when opening the jar now i wasnt expecting it to be just like betty crocker but it was pretty bad like others said it is a glueytacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on  it reminds me of taffy that hasnt quite hit the right stage in the candy making process  the taste isnt that great either and its sickeningly sweet even for frosting  the only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns  i still dont think it would be the right consistency
742,1,i can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought its kind of generous to call it frosting it has more the consistency of rubber cement and since we were in a time crunch we didnt have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it horrible experience bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum stuck to everything it came in contact with and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this it didnt even taste good by the time we were done decorating we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a premade cake our cake which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey was used as a centerpiece a really ugly centerpiece that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried
743,5,i work in college financial aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students  i used to buy them in the grocery store then learned i could get them for less online  for lb bag and thought that was a good deal  until i found this great deal
744,4,well worth the money i did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount  is an excellent value there are approx  pops in the box so far ive been through about half the box and have found about  without wrappers thats pretty good considering if you need lbs of dumdums go for this product enjoy
745,5,this is pretty good canned meat the sausage i used in dirty rice the hamburger i used for taco salad the chicken with wild rice and the pork with stuffing the turkey i gave to a neighbor because i dont eat it the various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for  large portions each can there werent large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans which ive experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats the proportion of liquids to meat was fair too its not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat none of the meat was seasoned at all this is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring there is a mild spamlike texture and taste to the meatsbut way better than spam any day almost a brine or something thats why i heavily seasoned it dont plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats it gave everything a slightly rancid soury tasteno idea why due to the higher calories and higher price i will only stock this as emergency food i will buy more for that reason

747,1,a watered down perversion of the acai berrybr br this juice comes on strong and harsh  with tart aftertaste and no texturebr br thats because it is mostly apple juice grape juice pomegranate juice blackberry juice blueberry juice and tart cherry juice  oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoctionbr br you shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here  there is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither  for that exotic unique acai experience try zola or samzon  brandsbr br im not saying that this lakewood juice product isnt nutritious  thats not my point  im saying that its a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice
748,3,this product is made by annies inc in berkely camade in the usa  the product maintains excellent organic integrity and it is stored in  recycled paperboard packagingbr br the manufacturers also support family farms  use organic milk butter and yogurt  the product takes approximately  min to prepare  the product contains dairy and wheat and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy productsbr br the ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta organic valley organic cheddar cheese organic cultured pasteurized milk salt nonanimal enzymes organic whey salt and sodium phosphatebr br this is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni  cheese dinner  this mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food  the pasta is firm and it has an excellent flavorbr br there are no artificial flavors synthetics colors or preservatives  the pasta was produced without antibiotics synthetic hormones or persistent pesticidesbr br this pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture  there are  servings per box  oz  each serving contains  cal  g fat sat  g fat  mg cholest  mg sodium  g carb  g fiber  g sugars  g proteinbr br however the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter milk or yogurt  to add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese you will have to add your own organic cheesebr br the cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta  i give this mac and cheese a  on packaging  for maintain organic integrity  on texture and a  for flavor
749,5,if this flavor lasted longer than it does id probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth
750,5,this gum is super sicktatooes are killinflavor is a spankinthis brings back bomb diggity memories yopeace out
751,2,my husband and i were very disappointed in this coffee very weak watery cup of coffee a definite waste of 
752,4,this is pretty good regular style soy sauce  but it is not superwonderfulbetter than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an asian market  the main value is as a unique giftbr   in the japanese soy sauce world there are  types regular mild usukuchi for raw fish sashimi and light colored  bluegrass soy sauce is regular style  compared to kikoman a good commercial brand that is widely available bluegrass starts saltier is flat in the middle then ends with a complex  interesting flavor  kikoman is less salty initially and has a round full flavor in the middle  doesnt have the complex ending flavors  for me the initial saltiness of bluegrass is a minus and kikomans full middle flavor is a plus  i prefere kikoman especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct  but i lived in japan for many years and am used to the standard japanese flavor  i havent tried bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor which is how soy sauce is usually usedbr   bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce  each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite  if you want a unique kentucky gift for an asian friend this is different than the standard bottle of bourbon or box of chocolate
753,5,i watched an episode o how things are made on discovery channell and saw bluegrass soy sauce featured  on a whim i ordered a bottle  it took several weeks to arrive but when it did  what a surprise  my teenage son wanted to try it and did  he loved it immediately  now he puts it on many things my wife and i were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much  in the past i made many trips to the far east and developed a real liking for soy sauce where virtually all of it is made  what a treat to find a handmade american product that competes with and wins against a japanesechinese national staple
754,5,my bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends  i had three soy sauces to choose from  after some sampling we were all using the bluegrass  everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness  we were splashing right on every piece rather that dunkingdipping friends wanted to know where i found it im going back to order more right now and ill be ordering  extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift thats affordable and unique instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common its boring
755,5,if you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like thisbr br plus its hand made in the good ole usa
756,5,i recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed  it has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands  ive used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra  quite a surprise to find an american made soy sauce that tastes this good
757,5,this soy sauce is the best we have ever had  thanks to amazon we were able to find it again  it makes a big difference when using this product  thanks again
758,5,this is the most delicious soy sauce i have ever tasted  i will surely order it again  such deep flavor
759,5,saw this on how it is made which was a very interesting processbr decided to give it a try i really enjoy the flavor it addsbr looking forward to trying it on several more dishesbr thanks to those who brewed it
760,4,most soy sauce is from japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields i am not sure how long the contamination will last i like the idea this product claims no gmo seeds yea  you pay more but decided not to take a chance on japan
761,5,im pleased with these wasnt sure how theyd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples but figured werthers was a good bet  im diabetic so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just cant happen as often as id like to do so  but these are tasty enough to get me through until i can carb budget  the real thing these are made with sugar alcohols so its wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless youre going to be near home and have turboflush on your toilet  tmi  this pack of  will last a while but theyre definitely a will reorder  
762,1,this item werthers sugar free hard candy if consumed will give you  or your friends loose bowels i purchased  bags and discovered more than a bowel problem you cant return them need a laxative i have ten unopened bags you can have  for free
763,5,this is a bold blend that has a great taste the flavor comes bursting through i usually brew  drink organic sumatra mandeling from bjs i use this blend exclusively so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my tassimo brewer is fantastic come on amazon add it to the subscription service
764,5,weve tried many tassimo flavors  this is by far our favorite  our normal cup of coffee is starbucks house blend out of a cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our tassimo  this coffee is rich but not too stong  i dont understand the current price over  for  disks and hope that it will be lowered on amazon  for now well buy elsewhere
765,5,this is one of the best choices in my opinion  i also adore amazon but they need to negotiate a better price for their tassimo disks  these are available at bedbath  beyond for  and i always get  off which brings it down to   they were  before the  off readily available coupons until about  months ago  again this is an excellent blend with full flavor  not bitter  i think its my favorite
766,4,i have tried about  of the available tdiscs and the kona blend is one of the best regularunflavored coffees for tassimo it has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering and has a pleasant aroma personally i would enjoy it more if it were strongerbolder however being a bit mild it goes well with breakfast andor glutenfree baked goodies i find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect nor is a subscription service available originally found this at dead bats from beyond used a  coupon and was happy with the final price
767,3,this coffee is good but for me its nothing special i will buy it again because its a nice mellow blend and my favorite daily coffee nabob must now be shipped from canada however on my first order to the canadian company its taking a long time to be delivered still havent gotten itbr br the reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this kona coffee is actually only  kona if you look very carefully at the photo of the disc you can see that information and theres a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description so its my fault for not reading more carefully but i was happy to see what i thought was  kona and wasnt careful ive bought the  kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the tassimo discs but i just read the product title and orderedbr br as i said the coffee tastes good the amount of coffee is the usual amount neither the small cups of some european coffees or the extra large size and i would recommend the coffee just be aware that this is blended coffee with only  kona and dont expect it to come in a flash as it did when amazon prime delivered it
768,5,of all the coffees available for tassimo this kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma bybr far my favorite
769,5,i think these are my favorite cookies ever really light and creamy too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than twohundred count i dont think i need that many
770,1,this kind of tea not good taste and smell so wear its not like tea and feel like some thing chemical
771,4,the milka naps mix gift box is a fun unique gift for those tired of whitmans and the usual american brands nothing wrong with whitmans but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nicebr br as a sampler it provides only a few of the milka options four flavors are here noisette hazelnuts alpine milk and strawberry all are delicious though i dont like strawberrychocolate in any candy personally and give those away to eager friends the naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at workbr br milka and its famous purple cow is owned by kraft is an eastern european chocolate originally produced in switzerland and is available in germany austria hungary and other nearby countriesbr br distribution is still weak in the united states but can be found increasingly in larger cities usually then it is found only in international grocery stores though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time it has been around  years whether or not kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen for now the texture and taste are better than hersheys and nestle it is a smoother creamier basic chocolatebr br i fully recommend the milka naps mix gift boxbr br anthony trendlbr editor hungarianbookstorecom
772,5,i ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two daysbr he said it tasted really good now i want to order some for myself haha
773,4,great candy and our family loved it  it was smaller than i imagined it and i thought it was expensive for how small it was  however i am in germany and can get it easier here  the shipping to the usa makes it expenive  great product and fun for our usa family to receive
774,5,i eat mustard with everything this is hands down the best mustard i have ever tried in fact everyone i tell to try some falls in love with it as well spicy tasty real qualitybr if you like spicy mustard you will love this
775,1,the laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it no other item inside our fridge turned bad
776,5,this product works wonders if you have stomach issues  i would buy again once i need more 
777,3,bought this at a local specialtyitem store because i adore chutney  because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item i wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket  wrong  it is mostly gel jelly with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwichesive had much better and thats just talking about the supermarket brands  very disappointed  money does not buy quality
778,5,our ferret loves this rabbit its a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular evo ferret diet the price was reasonable compared to our local pet store which doesnt often have this item in stock
779,5,my son made this  he didnt have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when half an hour before it was done it appeared not to have risen at alli feared for the worse  determined to be polite i agreed to have a sandwich using the bread  it was amazing  apparently it rises during the baking or somethingbr br great tangy flavor perfect for a meat sandwich imho and not heavy at all  fortunately we had lots of deli meats since the whole loaf disappeared within the hourbr br weve had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far im sure that will be delicious as well
780,5,these were great  just as described used them for a beethemed party and now we use them as to go packs of honey for our coffee and tea
781,1,this is not disco dust which is edible and made for baking do not purchase this product for such purposes
782,3,i was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken i couldnt send it back as i needed for a project
783,4,really easy project for family fun anytime not just for christmas just put icing between cookies and stack then ice outside and decorate great for all ages strawberry licorice rope looks like stuck together but just find end and unwindbr br  caution under  small hard candy decorations swallowing hazardbr br comes with everything you need except bowls an spoonsbr contains br cookie piecesbr large bag yellow colored icing  east to mix with just fork you add water slowly as to not get to thinbr small white icing bag you add water slowlybr green color to add to small amount of whitebr  clear decoratorbr  plastic decorator tips  can save to reusebr small bead candy for decoration chokign hazardbr strawberry licorice ropebr  small tube of orange writing icingbr hard candy wreath decoration about  diameterbr gummy spongebob about  tallbr gummy patrick about  tallbr br icing set up hard so when you go to eat  it has to be pried apart in pieces cookies do get a little softer in the middlebr br make anytime of year leave off wreat and patrick and cut out spongebobs head so does not look like chirstmas
784,4,my son is a sb fanatic so i was so excited to find this for the  holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread i knew by reading reviews that there wouldnt be enough yellow frosting so i whipped up so edible glue water and confectionery sugar to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside  this worked great it was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating the licorice was worthless though
785,2,this isnt as easy as it looks doesnt came with enough yellow frosting and the frosting doesnt stick very well my  year old did like making it though
786,1,i am a preschool teacher and do a g is for gingerbread unit every january i was on vacation during christmas and when i got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found which is odd i needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week i looked everywhere and could not find ont so i had one overnighted from amazon on nye and it came yesterday i pick this one because of the rudolph theme the gingerbread itself came broken like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken its non returnable i called amazon they were nice enough to order me a second one since i spend a ton of money each year with them this one also came broken i order a lot from amazon and things do not come broken i think only one time have i had returned something because it was broken in s of orders but two of the same thing in a row i think its the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped i will say most come ups and overnight comes fed ed but its bubble wrapped very well i think the gingerbread isnt good and cracks in shipping and breaks off the rest of the kit is very cute the first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box but the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags too bad but i would try something else stay away from this one
787,5,i was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order my speediest delivery to date it probably helps my location is near everything looks just as described and pictured and im very happy to have done business with this seller the gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside im excited to give this item as a gift
788,4,these cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eatbr the kids did not really care much but it might have beenbr more fun if they could have eaten thembr br they really had fun coloring them
789,2,i was disappointed in this product because i thought it would be biggerbr also it did not come with enough icing i had to use my own
790,2,the whole idea of a spongebob ginger bread pineapple is really great but the sticker that says use by has a  jn  date on it if thats  this is not good i think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration but my son is going to want to eat it  the least the seller could do is to check the expiration date its right on the front of the box not happy at all
791,1,this tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible  it invigorates like a puncture wound and the only revival is that after drinking you discover that you are still alivebr br well one tea bag was enough for me  my motherinlaw said oh that smells kind of like wine  okay kind of like wine with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste  if she likes it she can have the whole box
792,1,if it were possible to give this product zero stars i would have done so  i am a huge fan of twinings teas and was very excited to try this new blend  after arriving home from the grocery i immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner  between sorting washing and chopping items the hot water was added to the bag to steep  preparation continued until a distinctly off odor hit me  i thought one of my ingredients must be rancid  i hunted around for almost four minutes before i realized it was the tea  even after cleaning up and airing out the kitchen my roommate later came in and asked about the smell  save your money to purchase any other twinings product
793,4,this tea is the best tea ive ever had i first tasted it in norway and had to find it in the states i have it every morning
794,5,i love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me its a sweet tea which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinnerbr br i see that others didnt like it but its really a matter of personal tastedifferent courses for different horses
795,5,the best chocolate in the world in this critics humble opinion is made in the united states and the best chocolate in the united states is made in california by the ghirardelli chocolate company it is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores malls etc throughout the united states their actual stores are rare but kroger walmart martins formerly ukrops and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their productsbr br i have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these these are chocolates deserving of poetry you can eat them quickly or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one the choice is up to you
796,5,this is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one very tasty and a fast delivery too
797,5,my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven  they didnt believe they deserved receiving these but i know they did deserve to receive these
798,5,this is the best caramelchocolate combination i have ever tasted the caramel is liquid and complements the ghiradelli chocolate perfectly do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight  you will end up an addict like mebr   the ghiradelli product is far better than the caramellohershey product in every way the caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the ghiradelli squares and the caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste comparing the two is like comparing warren buffett to myself in terms of wealth unfortunately i am the caramello bar in this regardbr   at the very least try the ghiradelli
799,3,of course we all know how delicious ghirardelli chocolate is unfortunately after i purchased two of these gift bags online i found them in a local store for half the price lesson learned
800,5,this chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when i expected it to i gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it
801,5,the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you
802,3,are people really paying  bucks for these chocolates ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for  a bagwow
803,5,low calorie and satisfying these soups are a nice fill in when you dont want too much but dont want to be hungry for a few hours
804,3,this was really a disappointment while the products included are fine the real disappointment was the travel mug it is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it so it is basically just a cookie package yeah that is really what i want to use as a travel mug i agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store the product description says the polka dot tumbler is definitely a keeper what it is simply cheap packaging not something of quality to enjoy had i known that i would not have purchased the set i really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis i like the products inside and the basket is ok but really this what not what it appeared to be
805,3,it looks pretty but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality theres a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store the basket is nice though
806,5,purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal  she was very happy and loved the basket  she enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included  shipped quick and arrived when expected
807,5,received very quickly and extremely well packaged  since this is a smaller sized basket it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea for self or just to have to hand  very nicely assembled with attention to detail
808,5,these small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that i have never been able to find in the past when i wanted them  amazon now provides a link  they can be used for what are commonly called jello shots and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups
809,5,i bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party it was a big hit they are high quality and a good buy
810,5,great for serving chocolate liquor adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake
811,5,delicious chocolate cups each in its own aluminum holder  i could not find these in any local store so was happy to find them onlinebr most people are unaware of them so they are impressed when i serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup  after sipping thebr liquor you can eat the cup  what could be nicer  excellent product
812,5,the holiday liquor cups were exactly what i was looking for  the chocolate isbr delicious and holds up well to the liquors
813,4,strawberry twist has a longlasting pleasant flavor sweetbut not excessively so delivery is timely and price is just right supieror to other trident flavors though spearmint isnt bad either my next pick would be blueberry
814,2,trident strawberry twist sugarless gum is very disappointing both in taste and consistency the strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and though i guess it is a good thing not very long lasting the gum also gets stringy fairly quicklybr br i chew a lot of gum but will not be buying this flavor againbr br not recommendedbr br cfh
815,3,besides that mentioned in the title the only other remarks i have about it is the price is hard to beat the taste is akin to a flintstone strawberry vitamin for those of you that have tasted them and taste lasts for not very long  id say on a scale of  to  with  lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a   also the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time
816,5,i love this flavor and i cant find it on the shelves anymore the gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when i used to buy it in stores
817,5,if some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesnt like the taste i feel i must assert that in this as in all matters of taste de gustibus non disputandem estbr br i really love this gum ok it doesnt really taste like strawberry but its still delicious it has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through but then it gets tired stuff and squeakybr br youll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find as i did that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid by obsessively chewing this product i filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose  in  monthsbr br also it doesnt lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight
818,5,best dog food on the market today  had numerous ear problems with our cocker spaniel and they have cleared up since taking this food
819,5,my father could no longer take care of his beloved  year old cocker spaniel so i decided to take her into my family when i brought her to nyc she had ear and eye discharge she was also  slightly overweight after a check up with a vet that ruled out infection i decided to try royal canin based on the numerous good reviewswithin a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight this is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her
820,5,our spaniel has tried several foods in her  years and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any people food being added of course we still treat her occasionally  when we went in for our  month toothcleaning appointment the vet told us to take her home as her teeth didnt need any cleaning for another  months at least  it is specially designed for their teeth and health needs and she loves it  and it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store  what more could you ask
821,5,royal canin was recommended for my dog but since this line of dog food is specific to breed it was difficult to find in stores  petsmart and petco carried the cocker spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio  finding a larger bag has been a great deal  my cocker loves the food too
822,5,this is food especially designed for cocker spaniels who have a range of health issuesi have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it it also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time great product
823,5,i tired many different dog foods over the  yrs i have my cocker spaniel i then came upon this breed specific dog food  figured id try it my dog loves this food and always finishes his food ive used this for over  yr now  he has not tired of it i have seen a significant change for the better in him hes more active and doing wellbr br i only buy this brand food for him nowbr br buster gives it  paws up  i give it  stars
824,4,i bought this for my one year old cocker however all the dogs love it all their coats look better they all shed less eat less use the bathroom less my cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time i have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems it seems to have cleared up no more smell her eyes give her less problems and my yr old yorkie he eats less he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy our black lab mix hot spots and she would just lick her fur off all these great changes in a matter of a month  i do mix it roughly  with naturals dog food blend  they are doing greatbr br sept br i love this breed specific food however i just went to place my next bimonthly order and i am shocked at the price hike in just over a month  i paidbr  on aug  for a lb bag and here it is sept th and the price has is now  a difference of  in price  this is a huge amount to go up considering that i am assuming this is a price gouge due to the speculation over crops  i will look to my local vet for this product i can get a large bag now less at petco as well with the discounts they offer they will order a larger bag if you ask
825,5,fast and great service my cavashon loves this low fat dog food thanks arrived in great condition thank you thank you thank you
826,5,we are chocolate moose  mickey moosebr br our nice owner bought this great food for us  we love it very much i have gained  lbs because i eat all of mickeys food when he isnt looking  our skin and fur is much better now too  
827,5,my  year old cocker spaniel loves this food and its good for him  he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick  glad i found it on amazon  hard to find elsewhere
828,5,my lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much but as time went on i found more and more uses for it i have so many recipes that i make weekly that im running out this is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything ive found in the grocery store
829,5,better than organic oats advertised elsewhere takes lots of water these are not minute oats so my oatmeal cookies come out right not all crumbly and soggy instant oats have their place but not in cookies
830,5,honeyville rolled oats is a delicious product  i am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothersbr the oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is i only paid  shipping for lbs of oats  i encourage anyone who likes oats to order honeyville rolled oats  their flavor is above all the rest
831,5,nice flavor not too bitter  we really like this coffee  we have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole familys tastes and this is the one
832,1,the us made version of this cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the uk version of the chocolate which i have been eating since childhood i did not like this new taste to all my friends from india  buy this chocolate if it is either made in uk or india otherwise you will be disappointed as i was
833,1,cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured  new zealand is uses more cream than australia etc  this version by hershey is not what you expect from england australia or new zealand cadbury  it does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differentlybr br if you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non hershey versionbr br hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality cadbury chocolate to usa
834,5,my first taste of this tea saved my trip home from santa cruz when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags  how i needed my fix  a tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned and this chinese breakfast  yunnan black tea set me straightbr br other reviewers have said it tastes odd  the flavor is strong and a bit smoky like darjeeling only earthier  like darjeeling or earl grey it has enough flavor on its own  no milk or sugar needed  but its expensive by the box of teabags  finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic  it arrived promptly wellsealed and true to the label  unlike some loose tea thats actually cut up this has the whole leaves that unfurl  ahhh
835,5,this tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this teadrinking household we love it and it really starts the morning off right perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites the taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day
836,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbellxnumi organic tea chinese breakfast yunnan black tea loose leaf  oz bag pack of ai brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the halfgallon with this tea excellent the resealable bags work well and unopened they protect my large stash making it easier to manage my subscription
837,3,the taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of yunnan it is ok to drink but not to really enjoy i only make it for when i am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway
838,5,ive used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious consistently good quality black tea mainly i use it and several other numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha
839,4,i grew up on yunnan tea as a child  it was always my mothers favorite  so i was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a large volume habitual tea drinker like me this tea is my daily regular tea yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time its aromatic and flavorful without any additives if you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than earl grey this yunnan or a keemun may be a nice option to explore
840,5,it always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea  i have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and i never get tired of it  its an excellent morning tea is smooth without being insipid and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping just use decent water  i like a little stevia in it as im a wimp it brings out the natural sweetness of its malty slightly floral style  i just bought another two pounds
841,5,i hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent  i decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers  it is flavorful without being overpowering  it is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced  after the first try i have continued to drink it just as it comes  you can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea
842,5,i read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that i did i have purchased other numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products
843,3,to my mind a fine caramel should be creamy and melting  these are grainy  the flavor on these was fine although a little sweet to my taste
844,5,having eaten and reeaten my way though all of the das caramel range this remains my alltime favorite and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when i share them which isnt an easy thing to do  just try one and youll see what i mean  ive been a caramel fan for ages and while werthers butterscotch will do in a pinch nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these  they are chewy buttery and the little crunches of salt are spectacular ok my mother didnt put salt in hers this is an improvement
845,5,although i did enjoy the other flavor i ordered a tiny bit more the chocolate with walnuts one this was still a very enjoyable flavor  wonderful service from ms das including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors  id order this or the chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure along with more of das foods gourmet salt
846,5,this is certainly the best caramels i have ever had  i just wish it came in bigger pieces  i finished the whole box in one sitting  i will certainly buy them again
847,1,not my idea of a good caramel  flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated  same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties i missed the mix of rich buttery dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that i expect in caramels
848,4,being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer i am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
849,5,this baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons  i take it for acid indigestion and heart burn  just a  tsp in a half glass of water and its gone  i use it to make my body more alkaline so its great for changing your ph level in your body
850,5,i recently started using bobs red mill baking soda  im very pleased with its performance and i can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum  thanks bob
851,3,if you are concerned with an aluminum free product then this is the product for you  too bad that baking soda does not in any form contain aluminum  this is however a concern for baking powder which can depending on manufacturer contain aluminum  save your hard earned money and buy bobs red mill regular baking soda  arm  hammer is great for general cleaning purposes but for natural beauty and health care this brand is perfectbr br just thought youd all like to know i almost fell for it myself until i did a little digging around br br ps so as not to let all of amazoncomland feel i am one of those haters who dont really know what theyre talking about i love bobs red mill co and shall continue purchasing their excellent products
852,5,the product is of high quality and has a rich full flavorbr br delivery was unexpectedly fastbr br the only negative i would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack while this may be commonplace a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight food grade plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag  could be either a ziplock bag or a twist tie closure doesnt make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of itbr br this is a health and spoilage issue s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security  long term storage is a big issue with people like mebr br thom missouri
853,5,im happy with the quality of the product and the price like the other reviewer i would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness however i will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good pricebr br edit im on my th bag quality continues to be high
854,5,product is fresh good and im not getting complaints anymorebr br thats worth the large quantity and shipping chargesbr br hey its oatmeal my favorite
855,5,good quality oats package came on time oats worked well in recipes i will admit as a single person i bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food it lasted us for the yearbr br otherwise its an excellent buy
856,2,i cant eat these oats they have a funny taste to them  my kids also think they taste funny  my husband thinks they are ok so he has  pounds of oats to eat on his own
857,4,i looooove pocky got once at luckys and couldnt stop its like the chocolate is laced with crack anywho the product is good the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticksbr br great product and great price from this merchant
858,5,of the many purchses i made on amazon this past december i was most pleased with the pocky chocolate cream covered biscuit sticks pack of  they arrived on time and they were a hit as a surprised gift be sure to keep them refridgerated
859,5,got these for my kids as christmas stocking stuffers  they love them  as far as delivery the product came in good condition timely and was terrific  definitely a good buy
860,5,im not sure how you review something thats as subjective as taste but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker youll like this it doesnt taste exactly like either of those but thats the closest analogy for me  the sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracker to you dont get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingbr br heres some of the nitty gritty details  each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably  or so of the sticks  the packets themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both sides and pull and it opens up the package without any hassle  gotta love japanese product design    another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topbr br each of the packets has  calories  from fat and about mg of sodium  so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option  it does contain milk wheat soybeans and sheanut  so if any of these are an issue for you then youll want to pass  it also says on the packaging that the facility theyre manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts  the product doesnt use either of them but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to eitherbr br overall a great snack at a great price  the  pack really is  of the packets so thats quite a few snacks  one note if you live in a hot climate dont order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping  duh  
861,3,the chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother the product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting japan
862,5,first of all i love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldnt have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold i also want to thank veryasia for the free sample of mi gorengit was delicious i now love mi goreng
863,5,i bought these back in january and never got around to reviewing them i had heard many people rave about a japanese snack called pocky so i figured i would try it out just like the description states its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate i wouldnt say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess well as long as the chocolate doesnt melt anyways in case anyone is wondering i ordered from a seller named very asia amazoncomgphelpsellerataglancehtmlieutfisamazonfulfilledorderidmarketplacesellersellerajwisei i believe it took around a  weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever im definitely considering restocking on this in the future if i cant find a local storebr br edit oct  br br inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchasebr br so i decided to restock after i couldnt fight the craving anymore unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime what i received was not the picture shown on the front page  per pack japanese pocky it was a  per pack pockyish thing from thailand in my opinion the  giant pack compared to  smaller packs is definitely a step back packaging was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate the original japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthbr br personally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i wont be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i wont change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it would be a  the taste isnt terrible but its definitely not to my liking if possible i will be uploading some pictures of what i received
864,5,bought these for my daughters grad party as well as the strawberry she loves these things theyre a great product
865,4,everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this  it is addicting  that includes our  year old
866,5,pocky is just plain fun to eat i discovered these snacks at an anime convention though id heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them they are very very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness the chocolate flavor a nice nonbitter nondark generically pleasing chocotaste seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream very nicebr br this is by no means a health food its in the same category as a cookie its got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients but hey its junk food we all know its supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet unless youre really prone to bingeeating or cant stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number  of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back  calories with  grams of fat  of them saturated i wouldnt recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes in fact just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectbr br if you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like almond joy try the coconut chocolate ones theyre really so good oh man hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout caramel delights cookies which are in turn similar to the old yes yes cookies from the seventies or sobr br anyway if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating  fun treatsbr br however with this crazy hot summer id recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooler weather you might get a sticky clumped mess of pocky sticks in this deep summer weather look for local stores that specialize in japanese anime or manga and theyll likely carry japanese snacks like these in south florida tates comics has them in a variety of flavorsand fresh and not melted
867,5,pocky is an incredibly good snack but more than that i was impressed with very asias packaging i had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer on top of that the package of dessert pocky i ordered in  degree weather melted into this liquid goo tt so of course i was expecting all the pocky in my  boxes to be melted away but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading protect from heat and my pocky arriving in perfect condition well they did stick together just a bit i love very asia more than anything now
868,2,i think the pocky did not get stored rightly the chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick and doesnt taste as it should many of them stick together and whenever i want to split them up it just becomes very messy now i need to clean up my desk every time after i have it
869,5,everyone loves pocky and if they say they dont they are lying lol the pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces
870,5,these where great couldnt stop eating thembr lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next timebr cant say enough about these they where shipped faster than what i paid to have shipped alsobr thank you so much
871,5,i had bought pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no asian stores i have to shop on the internet the guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason for a bit of insanity search for pocky commercials on youtube
872,2,the individual pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped
873,1,this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award the box only contains  bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal so at least  of the interior of the box is air then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about  the length of a normal snack bar the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper if they were to not include wrappers those  bars would occupy less than  of the space inside the boxbr br as far as taste goes they are soso on the dry side with a hint of berry flavor celiacs who are used to inferior products wont be disappointed in the taste of this onebr br ive also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarterbr br i really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why ive continued to try their products i bought their granola many times always wanting to like it but it is some of the worst food ive ever had the clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than peoplebr br all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods
874,5,this was the first peanut free product i bought for my son  i thought they were tasty  the kids liked them too  for some reason they think they are strawberry bars  i love the soft texture and the non crumbly state  it makes for clean car rides  since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best  berry is always left for last  amazon has a wonderful price and i just wish it could be a subscribe item
875,2,i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy soy nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions  unfortunately these were pretty gross  miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry  i threw them away  i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free
876,1,my daughter had extensive food allergies as an infanttoddler and we bought these bars consistently  she still has the nut and egg allergy so i like that i can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe  unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter wont eat them  i have tried them myself and thought i might break a tooth i had them on subscribe and save which i have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat  i agree with a previous post i want to love these bars and i love everything the company stands for and actually really like their cookies but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing  i hope they address the issue and i will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture a total bummer   they were better in the past but something changed with the taste along with their new packaging
877,5,my son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars  i find that they have a good berry taste  they also have a nice chewyness
878,4,i love them not too sweet but just right any allergy free food is great in my book hope non of these ingredients contains cornthats a no no for me too however i dont appreciate the fact that i opened my new box and the cut  of it off if the size it less then so should the charge this will effect my decision in buying again i am not a toddler i need a real size bar please
879,2,i was extremely disappionted when i opened my shipment of enjoy life on the go bars very berry carmel apple and cocoa loco the boxes are now a plain generic designyou know the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper i then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes i still had at home guess what cheaper ingredients next i tastetested and let my  year old help he wouldnt eat the new onesand i cant blame him they are oily and bland i thought enjoy life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a goodtasting product i was wrong in summary these are way too expensive to be made with lowquality unpalatable ingredients
880,1,refer to the picture i posted above  the bar is half the size you think it is going to beit is literally a twobite bar  very deceptive advertising  that and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star  my  year old son ate one and didnt like them i ate one and agreed as did my husband  couldnt give it away  everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as im concerned
881,4,with all the allergies in our family these ended up working out great  we dont have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we dont buy many pre packaged foods these work for onthego our family tried several varieties and i prefer the cocoa loco bars theyre almost like a tootsie roll to methough i cant eat tootsie rolls so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving  my family prefers the very berry bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast need a healthy snack or my son will take them on his cross country running meets  they are very dense and fillingnot a soft bar and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time
882,4,im new to food allergies  my mo son was diagnosed with some severe fa and since hes still breastfed i had to drastically alter my dietbr br before learning about this brand i was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal  so when i stumbled upon this at my local whole foods i was very excited to try itbr br overall i really like them  its got pretty good texture taste and heft  its not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box which really isnt that bigbr br i know alot of people complain about the sizepackaging and i agree somewhat  but each bar is an ounce and  calories on par with many other breakfast bars  i like the berry flavor the best its the closest to real non fa specialty flavor overally im grateful for these bars because now i can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when i really need a quick snack i wont be left stranded
883,5,my son has severe allergies  this is an item he loves and is a convenience for me  i feel good giving them to him and they taste great
884,4,tasty convenient bars for people with celiac disease they seem to have gotten smaller over time but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size and the price
885,5,if you are looking for a great gluten free snack you wont be sorry you chose this product my favorite flavor is the apple and nut
886,4,this brand of granola bars are really good  the very berry are my favorite  however the bars are almost ridiculously small  yeah were gluten free so our food is a lot more dense than other food but honestly can we not have normal sized good tasting granola bars  they really are tiny  so the taste is great but the bar is small
887,3,they are ok but my husband only eats them when we are in car we keep them there for a celiac snack hard to find when roaming around he wont eat them otherwise they are definitely raspberry but are kind of drybr   we have never tried any other snack bars so in all honesty they may be the norm i dont knowbr   we do like enjoy lifes other productsbr   they are gf have no msg or related products or aspartates
888,5,great taste great ingredients great texture absolutely delicious they are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal i give one to my  year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more either that or they taste so good he wants more
889,5,recently diagnosed a glutenintolerant i have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life these snack bars fit the bill they have the mouthfeel of a traditional snack bar and a pleasant tartsweet fruit flavor
890,4,my son loves these fruit bars they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars  my suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones now my son favors them chocolate ones more than the berry ones
891,5,if you want a really good snack bar try these they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar but without the gluten i buy these regularly
892,1,imagine taking some kids playground chalk perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks then scoop it up and put it in your mouthbr br thats how disgusting this bar isbr br i have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful it has none ive done nutritional coaching for  years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellentbr br this neanderthalera gluten free bar is so bad i want to go to my local grocery store take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store perhaps if theres a trash compactor just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this productbr br save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything elsebr br enjoy life bars being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth
893,5,my brother bought me a pound of this coffee for christmas  he told me that weaver was the original roaster for petes coffee he eventually split off and started his own roaster  well let me tell you the stuff is delicious  ive never been married to a brand of coffee usually would buy the starbucks  lb bag at costco or whatever looked good at trader joes but weavers is in a class of its own  im subscribing to guarantee i can have this stuff delivered to me regularly  try it
894,5,this is the best coffee weve ever had a light taste but very full bodied i was very pleased with the packaging having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact i must say you wont be displeased with your purchase this is a must buy
895,5,this is the best coffee weve ever had  i run the american pavilion in cannes and weavers was by far and  away our most popular coffee sponsor  hundreds of people come to the pavilion every day looking for american coffee and they were not disappointed  we did a booming business this year  buy it  youll be so happy you did  julie
896,4,for those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white jasmine tea numis flower jewel is worth a look about the size of a gumball these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower they are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this teabr br decorative does not mean tasteless as a white tea the flavor is mild but rich and soothing the jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea i have had stronger jasmine teas but this one is quite balanced and tasty i used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than  yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade the white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and dont get bitter if seeped for long periodsbr br i must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the rd or th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf better packaging might solve thisbr br if you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells or are entertaining and want a conversation piece then numi tea flower jewel should be on your short list
897,2,the first ball worked pretty well it just looked a little beaten up  since then half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit  if you dont mind the rate of failure the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea
898,4,numi has a winner here with this tea my husband son and i often share this wonderful tea after dinner it is very pleasant and the reason they love it it does not turn bitter after longer steeping like other teas do
899,5,the product is all that it says it is which is why i gave it  stars  however i do have issues with the product namely me and my family members cant take the smell  the taste is horrible so i put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin  this was a few weeks ago and though ive since changed my sheets the scent is still in my bed  ultimately i stopped using it because it made me smell in a way i did not like  it smells like an indian spice and while it didnt work for me scentwise it may work fine with someone else
900,3,both our twins love this one right from the start but its not loaded with lentils see ingredients below  we introduced it when they were  months old and now theyre  months  im glad they are eating something green because we couldnt get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at  months but we got them to eat the peas later at  monthsbr br their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and weve also tried sweet potato with cinnamon they love all the fruit varietiesbr br im glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredientsbr br this one also has carrots and ive heard all babies like carrots  i dont know if they would like it without the carrots  i havent seen this one  lentils and brown rice  in our local stores so im glad to get it here along with some others we get this one with the subscription  of course with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and were so busy that its great to get these deliveredbr br the packaging is excellent  ive ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive brokenbr br ingredients per label water organic apples organic carrots organic brown rice organic lentils organic canola oilbr br this has  calories  protein  vitamin a  vitamin c  calcium and  ironbr br im informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult
901,4,my twin month old babies treat this one as dessert  their first earths best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes  after water sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one followed by apricot puree  thats dessert for them right there  after that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour not as good as brown rice thoughbr br this is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly  almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters  add apricot puree and theres really not much one could do to discourage babies after that  i recommend this flavor brandbr br ingredients per label water organic sweet potatoes organic apricot puree mechanically separated organic chicken organic brown rice flourbr br the rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice colorbr br nutrition per label  calories  protein  vitamin a  vitamin c  calcium and  ironbr br this one had the most vitamin a of all earths best jars ive tried  ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
902,3,i liked getting this one for my twin month olds because it has such interesting ingredients particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans  i like the fact that its vegetarian yet i believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice  this list of ingredients looks excellent and its a green color naturallybr br the babies liked it  they have liked everything that has carrotsbr br i have the subscription for this one as i really like the ingredients and the fact that im giving the babies food that is naturally greenbr br ingredients per the label water organic corn organic zucchini organic green beans organic brown rice organic carrots organic garbanzo beans organic canola oilbr br this has  calories  protein  vitamin a  vitamin c  calcium and  iron  ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
903,4,baby loved this one but as he has progressed i had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if i have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands it is all over i think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one
904,3,earths best turkey vegetable dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey you can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level  i just cant find nonsweetened and nondried cranberries even at the better food storesbr br apples carrots and turkey taste good to my month old growing twin girls  babies love carrots since theyre sweet to their taste so that made a great addition  the whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistencybr br the ingredients per the label water organic apples organic carrots mechanically separated organic turkey organic whole barley flourbr br in addition to  protein and  vitamin a it has  calcium and  ironbr br im very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through earths best  ive been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult
905,5,my little girl cant get enough of this i like that it is organic and contains fruit veggies protein and grains in one tasty meal i wish it came in larger portions since my  month old always wants  jars
906,5,its my daughters favorite first and foremost  for me i love that i can get lentils there arent many stage  or  vegetarian choices
907,1,wow i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other posters say they notified earths best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling no more earths best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they gotta do better than this to get my business
908,4,i like the earths best baby food line because of the organic ingredients amazon has great prices especially if you subscribe and free delivery to your doorstop which is convenient when youre a busy mom my daughter doesnt like a lot of baby foods but will eat this one as other reviewers have stated its a bit runnier that other ebs stage  foods so i add some oatmeal to it its also a bit bland so i add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up as an added bonus it works wonders for her digestive tract she had problems with constipation for about  months sometimes going up to  days before we had to give her a suppository and then i discovered that this food makes her poop every time i also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber i rated it  instead of  stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken i wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein
909,5,this is my sons favorite dinner best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein   vitamin a  and c  it is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it love love love this brand and flavor i think i purchased  jars so far
910,5,i dont know how everyone else got these broken but when i received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap not a single jar was broken  my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all
911,3,would be a quality product if it werent so thin nearly the consistency of soup it just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be
912,5,i would love to say that i have the time to make my sons food everyday its not the case honestly i do make it most of the time but some days you just dont have the timeenergy to get it all done enter this product before i bought this baby food i read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it its like a dessert yadda yadda yadda the truth is is that yes it has a bit of fruit in it but its not sweet at all the fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you dont have to add anything else its a great product to enter proteins into babys diet the consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also baby will not choke on it i highly recommend
913,4,we love earths best organic baby food but this is not the tastiest one ive tried it myself and think it is pretty gross but my daughter still eats it just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors its got a decent amount of protein which is important for us as a vegetarian family
914,5,soft smooth texture  my little one devours this oneit is one of the best meatveg dinners we have found
915,1,my triplets will not eat this eventhe one who will eat anything the consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon
916,3,my baby loves sweet potatoes i can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what i wanted to mix in there it was horribly runny like spooning formula into his mouth ick
917,4,my daughter was not a big fan of baby food especially any with proteins but she did love this one the flavor is just right not too sweet or too savory and doesnt have a strong chicken flavor almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp thus its a very good first protein to offer and good for picky eaters my nephews and my niece also liked this flavor so its a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you dont know a particular babys preferencesbr something i wish i had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other stage  earths best especially for having chicken i added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture and she liked that just fine but it is an extra step however the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gaggingtexture problems
918,5,this is the only food my daughter will eat consistly she really enjoys it the packaging is great never had any broken having ordered  times
919,5,my son loves the rice and lentil jars  its not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars  i have it on order with subscribe and save  amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged
920,5,i have twin girls they both loved the vegetable turkey dinner  it was one of their favorite baby foods  great price
921,1,i normally love earths best products as does my son however tonight after id given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was appalled  as this is my first child and i dont have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earths best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it dont buy earths best really disappointing
922,5,my son really enjoys earths best lentil  he eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more  the product shipped very quickly
923,3,i introduced my daughter to earths best organic turkey vegetable dinner at  months a bit early but shes advanced as she was  weeks overdue  she loved it at first  but i bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite  ive tried some of it as well  of all of them this is also my least favorite
924,3,we received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today i always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature i put them in a bowl and microwave for  seconds and taste ok when i tasted this i made a face because it was so yucky i added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon to her credit my  month old daughter ate some bites but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors i like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein
925,5,i love the fact that there is turkey being offered this is my sons nd favorite dish no issues with it and a good balance of nutrients
926,1,only three jars came in a form edible to babies  the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water  it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixturebr pretty disappointing and a waste of money
927,5,this is one of my sons favorite baby foods  it does have a bit of sweetness but not too sweet  its more runny than some of the other flavors so we use a deeper spoon with this one or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up
928,4,for whatever reason our son really likes this flavor im not a fan myself but im not the one eating it any time i can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting im a happy mom
929,5,the rice and lentil dinner is our sons absolute favorite i dont know why but he gobbles this up every time he enjoys most of the earths best foods and we have only found a couple he doesnt eat anything with too much apple which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar
930,4,my  month old absolutely loves this oneby far it is her favorite jarred baby food i like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food and im not ready to introduce her to meats yetbr br i do subscribe  save which brings the price down to jar thats a fair price  not an amazing deal but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store  the bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find  i have to go to whole foods my regular grocery store and target carry earths best but not this blend my daughter likes it so much though that i would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices its a good one
931,5,i always try the food before i feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good my daughter loves it she gets all excited when i make it for her
932,5,from  month to  month my son barely ate any solid food  he was so picky  we tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that hed actually finish the whole jar  i didnt expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it but i guessed it wrongbr now he is  month old and he is a pretty healthy eater  his current favorite seems to be tofu but he still loves corn zucchini brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this  i highly recommend to try this baby foodbr br also earths best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well  my son doesnt really like any snacks from gerber brand but he likes most of the products from earths best  their foods taste greateven for us adult and so good for you too
933,3,little baby picky will only eat this sometimes this one is more watery than the others so keep that in mind reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different so i hope letting you know the consistency and texture help
934,5,this tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too  hes constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these there is absolutely nothing bad to say about these i know some people have complained about the poor packaging but i believe that mustve been fixed bc ive not had any problems at all  in fact they securely bubble wrap these then place them in an aircushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time
935,5,i have  month olds and no time to write a great review but they like all the flavors the textures are great and the jars open easily great on the go snack
936,5,my son started eating this when he was around  months old hes now  months old and its one of his favorites unfortunately they dont carry it at the local grocery store they carry other varieties of earths best just not this one or his other favorites spinachpotatoes and spaghetti with cheese they do carry it at some of the whole foods so i buy them there im so glad to find them on amazon i get tired of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the storebr br we use this as a base and mix in other things  bits of cooked broccoli small pieces of meat ive also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors
937,5,my baby loves rice and lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat  if we are going somewhere i wont be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold
938,5,my daughter loved this stuff it is all natural and made very well  good to mix with other things as they get older too  beats gerber
939,5,my daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this  we tried rd foods on her and she doesnt like the texture of them  this is really good for her and she likes it so we keep buying it
940,5,my son loves the best earths baby food and his favorite seems to be the vegetable and turkey he smiles at every mouthfulbr br i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way all the food i feed my son is through earths best
941,1,to be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible up all night screaming from gas pains garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies
942,2,i usually make my babys food its so easy steam fruits  veggies and puree but sometimes i dont have enough time to cook and i buy earths best baby foodsbaby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didnt like this one she refused to eat it when i tried it i understood why i wouldnt eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately i made her a homemade potato zucchini  asparagus puree and she loved it i wouldnt recommend this flavor
943,5,my six month old baby loves the earths best nd sweet potato chicken dinner  its his favorite he seems to love all the earths best nd foods  fruits vegetables and dinners the consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat  not too thick not too thin
944,1,this is my daughters  most favorite baby food by far  this is the only ones shell eat and rarely will eat the other kinds  however the taste is very bland for me as an adult at least after you put the unfinished portion in the fridge it may become sort of watery at which point i throw it out it is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has especially zucchinibr i had to update my review today because i saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food  plastic in baby food i notified earths best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing but i am not giving my baby this food any more even though she likes it thats it for us
945,5,the earths best he eats the most this one is a little thicker than his original chickensweet potato favorite which is very runny
946,5,id continue to buy but im moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too
947,4,i didnt eat any but my baby liked it she said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in tuscany also i like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste i just learned this and am telling everyone  only glass recycles forever and if you dont recycle then you and i have nothing in common and you should stop reading here its not even a hard thing to do anymore nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy you just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day stop being lazy
948,1,i just wanted to post here that i found small bits of plastic in this food as i was feeding my  month old  plastic in food baby food  so please be careful if you buy this or are considering itbr br my daughter loves this food its actually her favorite  this is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over  months
949,4,pretty good product  the taste isnt the best but its definitely not the worse either  it gives a pretty smooth energetic kick
950,5,i am a true seattle coffee addict and i have never had a better coffee candy
951,4,sent this basket to my father for his birthday  he said the fruit was very fresh and sweet  happy with this healthy purchase
952,5,this fruit gift really was the perfect gift everything was fresh well packed and tasty looking and the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too and tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were so thank you i needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expectedso thank you again dharanasan francisco
953,5,i got it for my girlfriend for her birthday  the fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy  i love dark chocolate so i loved the dark chocolate almonds  next time ill give the organic version of this product to someone close so they share with me  
954,5,as a child my facorite memory was drinking sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my granddad i have never seen it in a tea bag before i found that to get the taste i remember i needed  bags per cup the bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that i will buy again and again plus the shipping time was great
955,4,i grew up in ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful i would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea  i purchased breezy morning sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only  average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product  not a good bargain  i switched to pappys extract
956,4,i ordered this online and received it in just a few days   the tea is excellent and the price was right for  me
957,5,i purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time i didnt realize it was so hard to find  she absolutely loves it made a great surprise christmas gift
958,5,i heard some great things about sassafras and wanted to try it  i was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated  im actually gonna order the pack and continue drinking it over time  dont trust the fda
959,5,bought this for my dad for about  years he would complain to be about how he hasnt had this tea since he was about  finally after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed i bought him the tea so hed shut up
960,1,i first tasted sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it  so i started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form  after several weeks of investigation i called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea  i was told is was pappys sassafras concentrate  i looked online and found it at amazoncom  as i was ordering it i also saw the sassafras teabags  i thought id order a box to try  i was very dissapointed  it didnt taste like the flat rootbeer i was expecting  it was more like black licorice which i hate with a very mild rootbeer undertone  it also didnt have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras rootbr br ive never had real sassafras tea made with the root so i dont know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not  bottom line  i wont buy the teabags again
961,5,great tasting tea i have been looking for a good  sassafras tea foreverfinally i will be ordering this product again br thanks kimd
962,2,i did not care for this product at all i thought it was the same tea my sisters and i use to drink when we were in elementary school i found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree
963,2,i purchased this because i read that it was a natural cure for hivesum how about not  it did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful  luckily a coworker of mine loves this stuff reminds him of his grandmother and i gave it to him  yucky yucky stuff
964,2,these are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety which can be hard to findbr br one thing to keep in mind though is the expiration or best by date  for example if you order these in april and the batch you receive has a june use by date it may be a stretch to consume the  bags before the seeds start going rancid on you  since theyre roasted in oil and unsalted these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety even if refrigerated upon receiptbr br amazon doesnt seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell so its a gamble for the purchaser  im assuming that amazon wont ship stuff that has expired but they probably ship out the oldest stock first and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice
965,5,i love panang curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it  so decided to try making my own and with this product i get exactly what i want hot tasty panang curry adding lots of fresh veggies tofu and brown rice  and its very hot didnt have to add any spices at all  great product will purchase again
966,3,i purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that i paid  times more than what i should be  for  cans is highway robbery now that i know that i can purchase one can for around  now as far as the item itself this brand of panang paste is excellent the beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the thai restaurant i would recommend the paste but not the price
967,5,best paste i have tried so easy to use just saute you meat add veggies paste and a tin of coconut milk quick and tasty i am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat it works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter but the yellow green and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out
968,1,omg i would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal degusting isnt even a strong enough word a horrible horrible mistakean expensive mistakethey advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why i bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when i just wanted plan peanut butter cookieshowever when i received them i found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but i thought okay ill try them and omg i almost threw up from the taste horrible horrible disgutingly medicinal taste do not buy if they had a zero before the stars i would rate it a zero instead of  star
969,5,this gravy mix is excellent  except dont use water where called for use milk instead and it makes it  better
970,5,im not from the south but live in sofla where sometimes we get a southern influence the gravy mix i am reviewing pioneer country gravy is delicious ive tried others publix brand mc cormick ect but this is the best by far i chose to mix  water  milk   cooked chopped sausage links and it was phenomenal on my  bisquick cheese garlic bisquits like red lobsters served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs its super easy to make and thick finger lickin mmmmmmm i heard you can put it on potatoesveggies and chicken make soups and add for seasoning pioneer brand as the name says is a homestyle american classic
971,5,nothing easier nothing better even beats grandmothers white gravy recipe already peppered for you you do nothing but mix it with water takes only a minute or two i highly recommend this gravy mix it will not disappoint
972,5,i have used pioneer gravy for a number of years  it is very easy to make and tastes great also  goes very well over mashed potatoes meats etc  try it
973,5,its great to be able to get sugar this wayits not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your bodyand i am helping the  fair trade farmersit is a good thing all aroundi am happy i can get it in amazon
974,5,i am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because i never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar  i really enjoy the starbucks via instant coffee  but i drink so much it is rather expensive so i thought i would give this a try  both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised with the taste  i dont think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable  i bought my first  pack at my local grocery store for about   that seemed a little high but i figured i would check online to find the best price  as i started calculating all of the online prices they are charging about  bucks for the  count  i would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper  so you dont have to do the math     per single  online price      shipping not calculated in  looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier you can get a case of  boxes for  no sales tax and free shippingsounds like a great deal   x    singles so      per single  the most expensive at all
975,4,i dont think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee but they taste far better than instant coffee  at work we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser  this brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee  i highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but dont have access to a coffee maker  individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings
976,5,i keep regular bags and decaf bags in my home at all timesbr never have to drink old coffee  best way to make iced coffee
977,4,i live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this especially when i need to stay up late to study or to wake up after  hours of sleep its just like making tea and tastes decent enough not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream
978,5,my primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by folger you get more coffee for less moneybr br   i recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years since i didnt know how many cups a day i would use i wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker i dont particularly like instant coffee i was delighted to find these folgers bagsbr br   they brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee im not any kind of coffee expert so i dont know what special terms might be used all i know is that if i let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute it sure tastes good thanks to my very much better half ive also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffeebr br   very convenient very easy very tasty i intend to take some of these with me when i travel as an alternative to the inroom coffee makers or yeck vending machinesbr br jerry
979,5,we cant have any kind of coffee maker at work so were forced to buy at the inhouse coffee shop or starbucks across the street in this economy no one wants to pay those high prices so we started a coffee club  of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh hot tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices thanks folgers
980,5,these are great for at work just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee this is the best tasting coffee its easy to make without a mess
981,5,fast easy and definitely delicious  makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make  good purchase  will continue to order from herebr thanx
982,5,i gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit and im glad i did it has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma it has a nice reddish color this tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea ive had and i look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that ive read about
983,5,i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review the flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity the color is that of muddy water and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well well worth every penny
984,5,i previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price  i decided to give pure matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive  the quality of pure matchas products surpasses that of all others i have tried stays fresh has a consistent texture and tastes great  both the quality and price are better than others that i have purchased for the same quantity  i highly recommend pure matcha and will continue to purchase
985,5,this is the very best marinade you can buy as far as i am concernedof course everyone to his or her own tastes but all in all i think anyone will like iti give it five stars
986,5,this is a great product for those looking for an msg and gluten free product and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there it doesnt compromise of taste either i use it as a soy sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should if you are celiac or gluten intolerant or even just watching you salt intake this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too
987,5,my poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try andbr our family really enjoyed it i looked at the ingredients and was quite pleasedbr with the natural ingredients and no calories
988,5,this hot sauce is one of my favorites its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy you can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle a mix of garlic habanero and other spices i put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week i highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce
989,5,i was never much of a hot sauce fan until i tasted black market hot sauce i was listning to the radio one morning and the createrowner was giving an interview it sounded interesting the djs were sampling the sauce and raving about it so i picked up a bottle at the local grocery its so good  i keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucksbarbecues and partys happy to see i can buy it online at amazon
990,5,this is my favorite hot sauce i liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor i have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great producti really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos
991,5,they have this in a local diner that i eat in regularly  i use it on all kinds of foods and i love it  its hot but not without flavor  i dont like those sauces that just burn but have no taste  this has both burn and and awesome flavor  i was surprised to find it on amazon just stumbled across it  i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce
992,5,i was browsing around on amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here i will just order and have shipped to my friends habanero is my favorite i love the heat and the tangy spiciness i also love the pineapple you will not go wrong ordering this up
993,5,this is my favorite hot sauce i buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy my favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce
994,5,so far i have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing my fiance and i use them nearly daily and i just picked up  more it goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kickbr br the sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears it is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use we love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice
995,5,absolutely love the habenaro sauceuse it on eggs sandwiches most anything for a good kick have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown producthave nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the productget out there and try it
996,5,black market hot sauce is wonderful my husband loves this habenero sauce its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it i in fact love the medium sauce the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it we used it for everything and you can use it with any mealbr br i like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness we love the medium  habenero kind of like a his  hers package thank you for your hard work guys keep up the hard work
997,5,man what can i say this salsa is the bomb i have all the different kinds i have it with almost every meal the owner is a cool dude hes dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since dont sleep on this hot sauce
998,5,this sauce is so good with just about anything i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles it has a good burn with a strong flavor im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon buy it you wont regret it
999,1,not hot at all like the other low star reviewer i got suckered by seeing habenero in the name and the  oz size some people might like the flavor citrusy and it has some fish sauce in the mix according to the ingredient label but if youre looking for hot this aint it
1000,2,i have to admit i was a sucker for the large quantity  oz when shopping for hot sauces but now seeing the size of the bottle it reminds of wingsauce bottle sizes  plastic bottle  it does have a convenient squirt top  but overall not very hot or tasty and made mostly from jalapentildeos  if i had seen the ingredients list i would not have bought itbr jalapenosbr waterbr vinegarbr brown sugarbr lime juicebr fish saucebr cilantrobr habanerobr garlicbr spice blendbr saltbr potassium sorbatebr xanthan gum
1001,5,i never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good this is the real babka that my gram mother use to make
1002,4,i am so convinced these are human animal crackers they look and taste exactly like human ones yes i tasted it and they contain sugar which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either so ill just give my dog very small amounts
1003,5,i have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them she loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy she is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth about  per box
1004,3,these little animal crackers taste good  my doggies like them but i wont be buying again they are like the human animal crackers  have flour  sugar  other bad stuff for dogs i will continue to buy the healthy treats for my doggies which they also love without sugar you might want to try wellness blue buffalo natural balance zukes just to name a few
1005,5,my chihuahua loves these lil snacks when she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles
1006,5,i purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends  both yorkies loved these treats  we had to finally buy more since they liked them so much
1007,5,these are just like the animal crackers we eat  the price is great and my little guy loves them
1008,3,the smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses even though the rose content is very minimal i found the smell overwhelming i did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid there is no shaker lid either you open it and it dumps i am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor i hope it is not chemically enhanced with the lid being loose and not sealed i have doubts about the safety of the product
1009,3,i was hoping these were more true caramels not caramelflavored truffles but theyre still delicious would definitely order them again and maybe extra for gifts the salt just makes them extra amazingbr br bummer about the shipping shipping on this item is reasonable but we bought the chocolate covered pretzels at the same time and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box there wasnt even anything fancy about the packagingbr br edit okay these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle the package wasnt shipped with an ingredients list and i had to go to the company site directly and find a wellhidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover theres a lot of shady ingredients including high fructose corn syrup for  a box i expect no corn syrup i also dont expect propylene glycol antifreeze in vanilla which i expect to be  vanilla beans and not artificial vanillin which sometimes comes from the anal glands of beavers im disappointed in the ingredient qualitybr br httpwwwpremiumchocolatierscomingredientinfophpbr br review goes from  stars to  id make it  but the extra star is because they are quite delicious
1010,2,ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try this one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste not going to buy again im still on my search for the salty dry version im after
1011,5,i tried this and i found it too saltybr plus i ate this fish sauce with some fish but i realized it was kind of redundantbr br im kidding of course this stuff is great
1012,5,i dont usually drink tea but i love this one i thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that i had to get it perfect with a little bit of honey
1013,1,the noodles in the box were all broken  the sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor  i threw out most of the skillet  i would recommend not purchasing this product
1014,5,cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever couple of tbls of cavenders and  vinager and  ho rest oil good
1015,5,its balanced its tasty its filling its good for you  what more could you ask of a breakfast cerealbr br i still miss kelloggs sister product just right which was a somewhat lighter blend i loved it they discontinued it but mueslix is a strong secondbest
1016,5,dont know why i cant find these in my supermarket but i cant  you get pack of  when you order  was afraid  boxes would last too long  instead found i need to order another pack
1017,2,on a trip to italy muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and i loved it  imagine how excited i was when i saw that kellogs sold this product  what did i learn despite the similar name this cereal is quite unlike europeanstyle muesli  while the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar this cereal is mostly a flake cereal while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at allbr br real muesli is made of rolled not flaked grains this has pluses and minuses  on the plus side milk does not turn european mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals  on the minus side european mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so ie while you are in the shower or while the coffee is brewing or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side  for those that are concerned about eating processed foods rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones  rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted flaked grains are fully steamcooked until they are mush pressed into flakes fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend timetomushiness  and certainly only the kellogs product contains hfcsbr br you owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from amazon or better yet single boxes from a local healthfoods store if you have one and see what you prefer  i eat the bobs red mill product available on amazon and one of my local grocery chains instead of this and am much more satisfied  i havent tried familia but im not crazy about the idea of the fruit flakes and the dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me  the other products are a hair more expensive than the kellogs but im willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior productbr br im surprised quaker doesnt sell a muesli product  given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the us youd think it would be a natural fit for them
1018,2,recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients then i read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup
1019,5,i bought this product online because although it is a kellogg cereal i cannot find a retail store which carries it and incidentally i would like to know why i called kellogg and they could really give me no good answer and suggested i try another product of theirs which i found not as good as this i appreciate that amazon offers this and i will continue to order it  by the way  it really keeps me regular better than any other cereal  try it youll like it
1020,5,this cereal is difficult to find in the stores so i appreciate being able to purchase it through amazon  my husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month  seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to but its the little things that count  p looney
1021,5,you could find this in local supermarkets about  months ago but now it nowhere to be found every time kelloggs makes a great cereal they quit making it soon after this is the case with just right that was the best stuff on the planet
1022,5,this has been my favorite cereal for probably  years  the grocery stores stopped selling it so ive started buying it on the web in packs of  boxes  i use them up pretty fast
1023,5,i love this cereal  not only does it taste good its good for you  its a pity that i cant find this cereal in any of the local supermarkets  other brands do not match up
1024,5,have been enjoying mueslix since early s  some reason i can not locate mueslix in local supermarkets in new york so i order through amazon  taste is perfect not so sweet  i do not care too much about raisins but in this cereal i do enjoy greatly  it is enjoyable way to supplement fibers with whole grain a perfect breakfast that lasts until lunch time  tried all different kind  choices of many cereals out there but there is nothing like mueslix
1025,5,amazons price may be higher than some grocery stores but it isnt in my store so this is a good way to shopbr i first tried this on a princess cruise ship  i found it is very good and filling  it stays with me which is very importantbr i am super please to find this
1026,5,i almost cant stop eating this cereali eat it for breakfast and then in the evening when i think i want something to eat and am really not hungry i snack on these  after all its healthy so long as i remembeer its not healthy to eat a cup or more  enjoy
1027,5,our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelfjust not the same  great that i could order and have my cereal within days
1028,5,mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago  however they have improved it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich  i simply add about half of a grain cereal such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price  stores keep discontinuing mueslix to the point that it is hard to find  thank you amazon
1029,5,this cereal is hard to find in local stores where i live my wife and i love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness whenever i find it in some hotel breakfast buffets i am a happy man i cannot think of eating any other cereal
1030,5,kelloggs mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in european bbs on our last trip not available locally but amazon provided with a fair price rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my prime shipping excellent form of muesli
1031,5,eating healthy never tasted so good tough to find in my local stores but amazon has it at a great price especially through subscribe and save
1032,5,the kelloggs muselix are delicious and the delivery was quicka hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbekbskkelloggs crispy blend mueslix raisins dates  almonds ounce unit pack of a
1033,5,this cereal is the best cereal on the market  it has many flavors including nuts raisins dates and especially a light malt flavor  i have enjoyed it most mornings for years
1034,5,i have been eating kelloggs mueslix for years i love the mix of fruit almonds and whole grain it used to be easy to find but when i couldnt find it in my local super markets i was afraid it had been discontinued when i found it on amazon i was pretty happy
1035,5,it was a sad moment when i was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores  im not sure why it disappeared but am so grateful im able to purchace this online  thanks
1036,5,its hard to find in the us my husband frm jamaica and he loves it he says it makes him fill full all day i get it every mo
1037,5,my mom who is in now new york in an assisted living facility loves this ceral  she was buying kelloggs mueslix when she lived in florida but when i went to buy it for her in ny where she is i had no luck i called kelloggs themselves and they directed me to amazoncom i was so please that they sold the ceral and i can have it shipped for free to her i also save money on each box and i also do not have to pay for the shipping so now you have two happy people my mom who gets her favorite ceral shipped directly every few monthsthey send  boxesand me for saving money and time shopping and shipping the package to my mom
1038,4,i have been struggling to find them in the shops nearbybr much more convenient to order them through amazon slightly more expensive but i save the gas and the burden
1039,5,the kellogg mueslix cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived the item was well packed contents were fresh encountered no problemsbr and plan to use this resource again
1040,3,i really like the mueslix cereal but the amazon price is awfulbr  for a  pack is over  a boxbr this product retails in the stores here for around  a box publix kroger inglesbr so the amazon price is higher than retailbr br mueslix is almost never on sale though unlike other kelloggs cerealsbr  times per year publix grocery has all kelloggs cereals for half pricebr box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeksbr br i expected the amazon price to be more like box since it was a  packbr but boy was i wrong
1041,1,its no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health unfortunately its also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified cornbr br since the late s hfcs has replaced regular table sugar honey and similar sweeteners in practically everything prolonged consumption of hfcs is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause longterm damage to the bodybr high fructose corn syrup dangersbr br  significant risk of weight gain  obesitybr  increased risk of developing type diabetesbr  hypertension and elevated bad cholesterol levelsbr   longterm liver damagebr  mercury exposure from hfcsbr br kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner look at the cover of post rain bran they are advertising that it contains no high fructose corn syrupi applaud them for this high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn from monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing colony collapse disorder in bees i am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with hfcs in them to save my family and the bees watch vanishing of the beesfood matters and food inc they are all sold on amazon excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat
1042,5,local grocery stores dont carry this cereal so i order it it is full of nuts raisins and other great stuff i cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar my favorite box cereal
1043,5,just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor what was surprising was the fact that i knew i had added to much seasoning but it didnt turn out over powering i would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat the jerky is great but the ribs are outstanding and for  including shipping for lbs awesome deal
1044,5,i try every asian salad dressing i can findbr this is my favorite one for salads because of its delicate tastebr my other favorite is newmans own low fat sesame gingerbr the ginger in newmans gives it a stronger flavor which is greatbr as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes
1045,5,wow this is soooo good and has easily become my favorite dressing i typically make my own dressings however i do use this one as a treatbr br it was given to me as a gift and i absolutely love it its a perfect balance of sweet and oily and bitter granted it needs a good shaking since its oil based i absolutely love this and am sad i am running out if you eat salads like me every day then you will want this dressing its unique and i never had somebody over who didnt love it 
1046,3,i bought the liter size bottles of this dressing on amazon so i am assuming they are the same since they have the same name and the nutritional facts are identical this dressing is definitely too sweet for my taste my wife agrees otherwise very good i use it on tossed salads only
1047,1,coffee beans did not seem fresh  no oil on them what so ever  i have tasted much better and fresher  will not order again
1048,5,this coffee company delivers on great coffee taste  i like my coffee with deep robust taste and jeremiahs always is  it makes me glad to purchase it  thanks
1049,4,this is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles  the bright colors of candy coating look great and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweetbr br however this price is roughly double what you pay at michaels or marshalls when they stock stuff like this plus you can get the same product but in a  oz bag on amazon here httpwwwamazoncomckproductsrainbowcandycoateddpblaorefsrieutfshomegardenqidsr comes with prime shipping too
1050,1,tossed this out after trying it  texture and taste were far below expectations  seemed kind of mushy and pasty  pricy to boot
1051,5,i actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes they looked great showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing in great shape
1052,5,this is the first time ive used the coconut oil from manila coco factory and i was so pleased with the taste smell and overall incredible quality that i will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends  i am so glad i tried it i have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health  this oil ranks high in my book also i liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast easy and painless thank you for having this product on your site amazon
1053,2,they claim this product is unadulterated which would make you think oh sweet its going to be the best because nobody elses coconut oil says its unadulterated  i checked out their website and for those of you who dont know you want to go for cold pressed oils if theyre not cold pressed it means theyve been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats which as anything goes can and usually does kill any good minerals and vitamins their site posts information on their extraction process as of today this is what it statesbr br manila coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary stateoftheart mechanical expeller manila virginflo thermostable to hold off the lowest moisture possible  to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to  years under normal conditions our oils are st and nd stage pressinduced without chemical solvents no bleaching no deodorizing no hydrogenation no fermentation enzymes  to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste this method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high up to  degrees celsius heat temperaturesbr br mechanical expeller is their form of extraction and they also say it sustains unique character blah blah blah when subjected to high heat temperatures therefore in my personal opinion it is not as unadulterated as their information on their products on amazon make them sound i will be steering clear of their productsbr br im sorry if my review offends some but if youre going to pay good money for something you should know about it i would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one i was looking for larger quantities which is why i looked at this product however i will be sticking with nutiva as their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open the information below is direct from their websitebr br what makes nutivas virgin coconut oil so special much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed within several hours of the coconuts being chopped the meat is coldpressed unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than  hours before pressing nutivas approach preserves as much of the oils natural color flavor and aroma giving you the best results for any usebr br if you dont care about how its processed it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils if you want to read some scary things look up the dark information on how those are processed yuck talk about horrifyingbr br thank you for your timebr amybr br ps i used to be one of those organic what kind of fruitcake are you think youre more special than anybody else people but i have learned so much in the past year and a half dealing with my sons allergies and intollerances theres more to it than oh its more expensive so its just making me feel special because i can afford it no theres way more to it than that i urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods its a way of life a healthier way of life we all deserve to live healthier if you live healthier even though it costs more in the long term youre saving money because you are healthier so that means less doctor visits less expensive and nasty harmful medications etc
1054,5,i ordered the white christmas christmas eve and christmas morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the christmas eve  its the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor i use it for iced teas all year round  i can honestly say that i never got into tea that much until i tried stash teas  i sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father and he called me to ask where id gotten it because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife too  once tried you will be addicted visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles  these make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies
1055,5,this is my very favorite tea of all i drink it yearround and never get tired of it like i do of others its good any time of the day not too strong but still nicely flavorful with a good balance of mintyspicyherbaly
1056,5,christmas eve tea which does not actually contain tea is not just for christmas eve although if you are frazzled it does releave the stress christmas eve is good any time i do not know anyone who doesnt like it and have often given it as gifts it is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as christmas eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint it is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk but without the calories
1057,5,riba foods based in houston texas makes this awesome black bean dip it is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it i am not sure why in dallas tx its so hard to find  maybe because riba has so many good flavors i make the traditional layer dip with this instead of the refried beans and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce try it its not too too spicy but is very good
1058,3,i was expecting to receive only starburst when i received this it was half skittles which i did not want or need  i needed only starburst  next time i will just go to the store
1059,2,the goodbr br walker shortbread cookies are my favorite i love them  i bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each  if this were the end of it a five star reviewbr br the badbr br unfortunately amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the walkers cookie company  after ups was through with the shipment my cookies were reduced to crumbs  i contacted amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response  since i bought these shipped and sold by amazon i wont be purchasing these cookies from amazon again
1060,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgcvlxgwalkers shortbread highlander shortbread portion pack  ounce units pack of abr my family loves these its a great snack to carry in the car or its a wonderful surprise in a lunchbag the flavor is so rich and purei forgot how wonderful these shortbread cookies were and the price is nice tooas well as amazoncom i love this place
1061,5,walkers highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie so it was great to find them prepackaged into  biscuits keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking
1062,5,if you like shortbread you will really like these walkers always makes the best shortbreadbr a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgcvlxgwalkers shortbread highlander shortbread portion pack  ounce units pack of a
1063,1,my cookies were in such tiny broken pieces they were useless upon complaint a second mailing arrived several weeks later the cookies were again in crumbs the cookies were packed in  a box with a pitiful single air bubble i gave this feedback and expected some effort to improve on the packing but no same packaging same useless cookies  having enjoyed these highlanders in the past it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money
1064,5,couldnt find these anywhere but on line  it was worth the wait because they are trully great tasting cookies
1065,5,yes these cubes are expensive in fact i almost gave them four stars for the expense  regardless these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product  ive tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on amazon and in your grocery store and none of them compare to the rich sweet unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by la perruche  because ive tried so many brown sugar products i believe the difference is the terroir or the groundland where this sugar is grown  la perruche sugar cubes are made from african grown sugar more specifically sugar grown in swaziland andor the congo  also the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes  i dont know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished but the cubes are not regularly sized but are large and irregularly shaped and heaviersturdier than cut cubes by other producersbr br the flavor is a rich distinct and more molassesy flavor than other brown sugar cubes and is somewhat darker as well  i wish i could describe the flavor better but it has been several months since i was able to find a somewhat affordable supply  btw now that this product is being sold with free shipping via amazon prime i just purchased several boxes  it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago  recommended
1066,5,we love these sugar cubes in the office  they arent your grandmothers sugar cube  they have a rugged appearance can sugar cubes be considered rugged  and we combine them with the white sugar cubes from la perruche
1067,4,love this for espressosthe raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor
1068,3,its a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes but this was x the cost of granulated raw sugar
1069,5,due to my husbands and sons inability to eat gluten cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes  i am very concerned with the prolific use of gmos in corn especially and my familys increased consumption of it  i wanted to find an affordable gmo free cornstarch product to use in all my baking  rumford natural cornstarch is the one  ive been using it for months now with great success  satisfaction
1070,1,i purchased this product because of its name rumford naturals corn starch the word naturals appears large and clear on the pictured product label also the amazon description said it was made from nongenetically modified corn the label on the product that i actually received does not say rumford naturals but it is still made with nongenetically modified corn i say made with because this product now contains more than one ingredient its ingredients are cornstarch calcium sulfate and one of the suggested servings  tblsp contains  of the daily value of calcium that makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation on the other hand for persons who must restrict their calcium intake example some persons with kidney stones it can pose a potential problem even danger amazon provides themselves with a nice out for this they list the following legal disclaimer actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website we recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels warnings and directions before using or consuming a product but it is not fair for amazon to not at least list the correct ingredients and photo of the package so that you do not have to order the product in order to read labels and find out what you have purchasedbr br i will not buy this product againbr   because i dont need extra calciumbr   because i dont believe that the calcium sulfate was added out of interest in the consumers healthbr   but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brandsbr   and still be touted as having been made fromwith nongenetically modified cornbr  and just on principal because i cant afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning itbr br i am very very displeased with amazons incorrect listing of the product which was brought to their attention when i purchased it in february  and so far nothing has been donebr br although calcium sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as plaster of paris and if you use too much of this product basically the same amount as i had previous used of pure corn starch the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container i make pudding in pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every  seconds will remind you of damp plaster
1071,1,was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday  seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them safe  
1072,5,if you love garlic i recommend this flavored oil  it is true to its name  i was not expecting it to be so strong so if i use it for cooking or dipping bread i will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future
1073,5,these things are awesome perfect size truly wafer thin consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior they are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint i first tried them when i was living in germany  years ago and to this day no other mint comes close and the copycat ones disgusting go for the original you wont regret it each mint is in its own sleeve so you can pass them out without ever touching one elegant and delicious love them
1074,5,love these mints  they melt in your mouth and taste better than any others i have tried  just wish they werent so expensive  you cant eat just one a couple  they are addictively delicious
1075,5,i got it for my girlfriend very good stuff now everybody in the house eats them very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint
1076,5,a friends favorite candy is after eight but they are not available anywhere in my area  i couldnt find them online either  amazoncom came through  these are imported from england and the most delicious peppermint  these are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell  if you just want a little taste of mint this is for you  really special with a cup of hot coffee
1077,4,natures recipe is now a division of that mega company del monte foodsbr br the testbr br the neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag it consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in when the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of farm selects unmixed and readily took to it since then theyve been eating it mixed with their blue foodbr br i thought evie and piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there but they dont specifically target the vegetables to leave behindbr br the quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list only one ingredient that animal digest makes me cringe a little the girls dont mind it a bit for goodness alone i can heartily recommend this natural food but the price on it is relatively high rachel rays dry dog food for example is about half the price of farm stands selects and buffalo blue is about the same price for a household like ours with three dogs the farm stands selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively wed feel obliged to mix another good but less expensive food with it for those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue i say you cant go wrong with farm selects
1078,5,you will not find a better loose green tea for the price  i was able to get free shipping as well since i bought it with something else that totaled over   this is the tea used by many japanese people  do not fall for those highpriced organic green teas produced by american companies  they are goodbut you are not getting anything better than hime ban cha tea
1079,5,this is the favorite green tea in our household  been using it for years  was happy to find it here on amazon otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it  cant even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more  by the way ban cha in japan simply means common or everyday tea  not ceremonial
1080,5,i love this tea it is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas it is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitterit has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy tooits great without sweetenersbr  it is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurllong and slender a little tea goes a long way enjoy
1081,5,i have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when i was going to syracuse every summer  this year i stopped going there and didnt know where i was going to buy my tea until i spotted it on amazon and purchased it  i was so pleased  that i could get it so i am now a happy camper once again
1082,5,this is the real deal genmai cha loose green tea and roasted brown rice not in bags originally known as the peoples tea for those who couldnt afford better very popular because of its mild flavor you can drink it all day long like i do you wont be disappointed
1083,5,gatorade g is the way to go when you want the benefits of gatorade without quite so much sugar as i am in a prediabetes state these days i am drinking this type of gatorade instead of the regular gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it the really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after i exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my systembr br g comes in flavors including fruit punch and grapebr br if youre on the go the advantage of these bottles of gatorade is this because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular larger size bottles of gatorade gbr br i highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular gatorade
1084,1,all my fault i thought this would be a carton of  boxes of cereal  instead it was  box of cereal for  who sells cereal for this price plus  shipping  i feel stupid  buyer beware
1085,1,this is not jerky this is processed hard like a rock very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you cant break into anything smaller than  inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat the dogs lb dogs that will eat anything were not impressed it was hard to chew and it sounded like they were crunching rocks most of them spat it out after a few chews left it there this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives these dogs will work for lettuce where is a zero star button
1086,2,i ordered both the beef and turkey flavors my dogs would not even take these in their mouths both flavors were  very dry and had no real aroma to them try a small quantity first i  donated the entire order to the humane society
1087,3,this does not reflect on the product but my shitzus took them and left them laying on the carpet normally with chicken or turkey snacks they go nutsi donated both containers to the humane society id try a smaller quantity for a first order
1088,1,this is not jerky this is processed hard like a rock very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you cant break into anything smaller than  inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat the dogs who will eat anything were not impressed it was hard to chew and it sounded like they were crunching rocks where is a zero star button
1089,5,my partner is very happy with the tea and is feeling much better since starting to drink itbr she has been drinking it both hot normal and iced chilled and likes the refreshing nature of it
1090,5,this tea won an award in the usa and i know whymandarin silk loose leaf oolong tea  is like the name suggests silk silk on your tongue  a tea that has a warm relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderfulwell done art of tea
1091,3,i originally ordered two teas from art of tea  the silver needles and the coconut creme when my package came in they had shipped the coconut creme and mistakenly bundled it with this mandarin silk tea by accident i contacted amazon and they refunded the silver needles and told me i could dispose of the mandarin silk oolong as i saw fit well since im never one to turn down tea i chose to dispose of it by well drinking itbr br this isnt a bad tea first off i dont have too much experience with oolongs but i do like the flavor of this however i dont taste too much of the mandarin it almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea and it has a similar light greenyellow color i drink it with a little honeybr br all in all its a decent tea i dont think ill order it again but ill certainly finish off this tin
1092,5,these are identical to jays hot chips are they made by the same company  they have a slightly sweet taste with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat on a heat scale of  i would give these about a   regarding the texture these are not kettle cooked chips so they do not have much crunch they are comparable to regular lays chips  for about  a bag they are a great deal
1093,4,i first had these uncle rays chips a few years ago while traveling out west i tracked them down on amazon and recognized the name they are just as good as i remember smoky sweet with just enough kick and theres adequate seasoning on all of the chips each bag also has a little story courtesy of uncle ray that usually has some moral message or anecdote they are pretty funny but not intentionally my only problem with these chips is their texture theyre a bit thin and theres not much of a crunchy texture otherwise these are good chips and well worth trying out
1094,5,i am from michigan but have a vacation home in canada i have always been a fan of the primarily canadian product ketchup chips uncle rays is a brand ive seen around there frequently since this is such a hard to find product i expected to pay big bucks to buy it online imagine my surprise when i found these chips on amazon for a little over a dollar a bag cheaper than the retail i would pay in canada unbelievably delicious ps the dill pickle chips are really good too 
1095,5,mine came with stickers to sell them for  but they cost more like  so if for retail that is not much of a mark up i bought these for myself so that doesnt really matter and they are cheap similar to lays but cheaper unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips great product great price
1096,5,im not a potato chip addict but sometimes like them as a snackbr br i chose these because id never tried them beforebr br they are delicious zesty slightly sweet and spicyits like a combination of sweet and tart at once the oils in these chips are better for health it is hard to put the bag downbr br they are made in detroit michigan and contain no trans fats thats good enough for me try them
1097,5,these are some of my favorite chips on the planet they are light crisp  not too greasy the flavor is very dilly love that great chips just hard to find
1098,5,these chips are really good they taste better than other name brands theyre cheaper too  they arent too salty like other brands the flavors blend really well just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in once i start eating them its hard to stop lolbr br i will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand not sure if i can state the name brand or not 
1099,3, bags of chips were open when i received the shipment i am hoping that the chips werebr blew open during shipment in flight  no more chips for me through amazon  otherwisebr the chips are good to eat and very salty
1100,5,not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it  interestingly enough they feel more gourmet when eating these the flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese
1101,1,we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before always been pleased except this order  just not the samebr seasoning as usual generally lacked much for taste not sure if they have reduced the seasoning in their processing but out of case we bought we have opened and thrown away  bags already very disappointed with this order
1102,1,i have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since i was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in canada this is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available i recently got back from a trip to montreal where i ate at least a pack a day i decided i really wanted some around and was happy when i found these on amazon unfortunately the flavor is nowhere close to the brands ive tried before theres a sort of smoky barbeque sauce thing going on not that theyre as good as bbq potato chips which i love they just dont taste like ketchup i tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me then just threw them all out yuck
1103,5,i thought they were very good chips delicious  and as soon as i run out ill be ordering more very soon
1104,2,after reading all the good reviews on these chips i have to admit i was disappointed perhaps i just ended up with a bad batch but i could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt and i mean black chips in these bags hopefully the other flavors are better but im going to stick with other brands from now on
1105,5,these are hard to find but worth the trouble  very tasty and very reasonably priced  love the product and received very quickly
1106,5,i love uncle rays potatoe chips they have alot of spice on each chip  they taste spicy with a tang of sweet when i order a box i pass them out to friends who love them my husband my kids and i eat a whole bag at a time  i limit myself to ordering only twice ayear the salt content makes me blow up but i still love them
1107,4,i love old dutch ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the us and pricey on ebay  i tried herrs but they were dull  very ketchupy but not the tangyvinigary ketchup bite that old dutch has makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many  uncle rays are decent  more of a kick  many loaded chips which i like still not the addictive bite i love  so  if you love herrs these may be too much for you  if you love old dutch give these a shot  i am still on my quest for something equal to old dutch
1108,5,i confess i was originally looking at a different name brand but they were out of the salt and vinegar which is the only flavor i eat  i had never even heard of uncle rays let alone tried them but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping  i am happy to say i was very pleasantly surprised with these chips  somehow or another even though they just seem to be in a normal box when i opened that first bag i had a nice mix of big chips and little chips  the salt and vinegar blend well so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar  in any case theyre terrific  i was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product but im very glad i took the chance
1109,5,its difficult to purchase nosalt potato chips at most retail stores so i ordered a case of  ounce bags of uncle rays  they are great  not oily and they taste great  you get the potato flavor instead of just salt  ill be buying these from now on
1110,4,we can rarely find these potato chips where we live so i decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings we cannot be happier with the ordering from amazon the chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing excellent and will be ordering again
1111,1,these had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning the first  cases were amazing best i had ever then they restocked and tried  cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them what a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money bad uncle ray
1112,2,the flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good  however the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty and thickly encrusted with it the flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes  messy and unpleasant  needs lighter flavor coating
1113,3,the uncle rays bbq potato chips are comparable to lays or most commonly available chips in local markets  the bbq spice ia a bit too much the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips  i wont think about buying these again even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip
1114,1,bought uncle rays wavys  oz potato chips because purchased  uncle rays  oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased oh how wrong we were  do not purchase the wavys chips  they are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store broken brown very poor quality  very very disappointed  do notdo notdo not purchase uncle rays  oz wavy potato chipsbr br october  br br bought uncle rays sour cream and onion flavored chips for the th shipment with extreme disappointment the other  four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavorbr br the additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us  this shipment of chips are awful  bags are extremely deflated so was expecting to be stale however was not so  cannot not explain the semiflat bags  chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes  you know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off the seasoning on these chips is like that  it appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too too much   we just opened three bags just now because the first bags was awful opened second bag  awful opened rd bag  also was awful  left with  more probably not edible bags the chips really appear to be the not so fresh burnedbottom of the barrel get rid of leftovers  very very disappointed  will not buy again
1115,4,i have now tried both the ocean fish and tuna and the duck and chicken variety of this food  my cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better but i will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits hes gotten especially from the ocean fish and tuna that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding  also with this food he doesnt drink much water but still goes potty alot so i feel good that hes getting plenty of fluids in his diet  my only complaint with this brand and why i only give it  stars is that it has little pieces of potato and whole peas in it which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful which i dont like given the price  not that big of a deal but it is a minor inconvenience that i have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily  in case you are wondering it is approximately  to  whole pea pea size potato bits per  to  can
1116,5,who doesnt like vegetables that are portable and at a great price  cant beat the convenience at about  cents per package
1117,5,everything americolor that i have purchased works great i was looking for some lighter tone colors everything i had was pretty bright these sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen its great thank you
1118,5,i love the metallic and sheen colors  in a photo the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real  the sheen really kicks the color up a notch
1119,5,ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next daybr they came four days after weddingbr but they are nice
1120,3,just in case if anyone doesnt know what white tea is as opposed to green or black lets quote wikipedia white tea is fastdried while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan while kept moving for even curing oolong and black teas are fermented before curing what does it mean for me it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day objectively and scientifically speaking white tea is said to have more antioxidants and less caffeine so in my view its overall better than coffee or the black or green varietiesbr br this particular product while it comes in tea bags its not exactly your supermarket variety unlike the cheap teas black green herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags the choice brand is delivered in pyramid shaped biodegradable nylonlike bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves not some indistinct crushed powderbr br this being a white tea delicate and subtle and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case i found the added flowers to be a little too strong bordering to overpowering for my taste the lychee and osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste  think of sweet green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma if its not love at the first sip give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors or notbr br ingredientsbr br  organic fair trade certified white teabr  natural lychee flavorbr  organic osmanthus flavorbr  contains caffeinebr br the somewhat offbalance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer time will tell but at this time  stars meaning its okay seem to be the fair rating
1121,4,as soon as i opened the teabag envelope the smell was truly divine nasal candy   as good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled the tea proved to be rather bitter  i may have steeped it too long so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less  however as i prefer milk or cream products in flower teas the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had  lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea  i suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea  will definitely reorder
1122,5,if youre looking at choice tea youre probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic fair trade ingredients for teabr br but choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations as for design lychee white is part of choices new line characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramidshaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves as for creative ingredient combinations this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms the flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate
1123,5,sent very prompty tea is delicious will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm
1124,5,i loved this tea it is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener a great buy i would definitely recommend this product
1125,5, boxes under  each for all cherry  great buy  i couldnt find all cherry in the store and dont really care for the other flavors
1126,4,almost  charms blow pops for less the  cents each  these are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane
1127,1,be careful  i ordered a pack of  my invoice says pack of  but i received only  stick
1128,1,even though the item says pack of  i only received one i called them up to see where the other  were and they said that amazon put it incorrectly seriously they are issuing a refund but still i wanted  which is what the item says and instead and only getting the  should we just not trust whats on amazon now
1129,4,this salsa is definitely one for the books a perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for halftime grown men crying because its soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar perfect for my cream cheese dip too a across the board
1130,4,this salsa was delicious it was very spicy as im sure youve guessed but was also pretty dang tasty it was a bit sweeter than i prefer my salsa and given the price i dont think it is something i would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing you just might end up loving it
1131,5,nice combination of ingredients so that it is very hot yet still has great flavor it has a little added sugar which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix for the hotter salsas you really cant go wrong with this this is one of my top four favorites which include mrs renfros hot salsa screaming sphincter and pain is good 
1132,5,i am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor half the bottle was devoted to given people my not so hot salsa  reactions amazing  worth the money as for me eating it the title says it all
1133,5,my cats  of them love this food so i was glad to see amazon is carrying it again the local stores do not carry a  lb bag only the lbs and  lbs this food is sealed very well and is fresh i have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food and so far  lives agrees very well with my cats this food does not rifle through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors like cheapo cat food and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy my cats ages range from  years to  years old and believe me this  lives brand and flavor are something they all like the price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is freebr br i also buy the iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love again no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years nowbr br if you do try this or switch your cats over be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust in the end i think you will be very pleased with the quality and pricebr br also we used to take in foster cats and fed them this  lives brand and they all did very well
1134,5,my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one
1135,5,i used to buy this at target but its cheaper at amazonbr br my cat goes crazy when i get out the bag so i know she loves it cheap to boot alsobr br i dont really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food i figure its all pretty decent so why not save a little money
1136,5,there are  kittens that started hanging outside the house and i started feeding them  rather than buying the smaller bags this is a great value for multiple cats  the kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it  shipped right to your door  cant go wrong with that
1137,4,i purchase   pound bags of  lives daily essentials a month for my daughters cats they love it she says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it they know whats in there and cant wait for it to be opened if the cats love it we love it isnt that how it goes
1138,5,my cats love this food for the money it is a great product i get it every month  the cats love the flavor
1139,3,as the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cats well being i dont actually feed my cats this dry foodbr br corn is the first ingredient which is a food my cats really dont crave  there is a meat source as the second ingredient but unfortunately it is a byproduct  although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any catbr br however the amazon price is good and with amazon prime day free shipping directly to work this is a very convenient food for the shop cats i feed  while the ingredients arent the best feeding it along with canned food it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy
1140,5,i have  feral cats that i trapped neuteredspayed and released  they still hang around our property so of course we feed them  they really like  lives and i believe it is good for them  being old and my husband handicapped it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home  i am very satisfied with the product and amazon  the subscribe and save option is even better as i dont have to remember to order it
1141,5,my two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand  its also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart i would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day  get lives dry cat food  its one of the better brands out there
1142,5,one of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this great product to buy
1143,1,my cat will not eat this food i dont know why but it was a waste of money i was looking for something cheap so i guess you get what you pay for
1144,5,i love these pop  these are rather small pops about  the size of a tootsie pop  they come in many flavors  i think this bag is great in the long run   just think halloween
1145,5,dum dum lolly pops are the best they come i lots of kinds and tast really good
1146,5,this stuff is great if youre looking for a nonalcoholic vanilla extractyes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff i read somewhere on the net that the only reason they cant call it an extract is because it wasnt extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavorbr the smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified the texture is a little bit like honey i think its the glycerinbr br going to buy again for sure
1147,5,not paying attention i thought this product was simply vanilla extract when i purchased it tried it in my coffee and got a shock yummy  i had to go examine the bottle and realized my yummy mistake  i wonder what glycerin is what its made of is it a fatbr at any rate it is delicious
1148,2,i like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my babys pancakes  it does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff  it is rather bland in my opinion
1149,5,i prefer the taste of this over the alcoholbased vanilla extracts particularly in uncooked items and beverages it has a fairly thicksyrupy consistency
1150,5,raw organic fair trade tastes great whats not to love my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit
1151,1,i just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that both of the bricks were broken and unusable as a servingcooking plate  they were busted completed in half they were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box  i went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return  this is the first return ive ever tried to do in over  years of purchasing items off of amazon to the tune of several orders a month and yet the one time that i want to return a defective product i cant do it  i will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what isnt in the future
1152,5,excellent in cereal or on top icecream sundae i use them in my ramen noodle hotsour soup as well  very very good  almost a lite peanut flavor  not too much salt very lightly seasoned a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet  even the dog loves them thinks they are some special treat
1153,1,items in this gift basket was delivered to people who called me to say could not eat any of it because everything was old and stale  i was sad and disappointed time and effort as well as money to get this only to find out  terrible
1154,1,very disappointed with purchase  the dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates  must have been sitting there for a long long time
1155,2,i ordered three of the trays being a date nut and found that two were old or stale i admit to not checking the outofdate on the exterior package but still  dried out fruit the last tray was fresher but the experience was soured at that point im disappointed
1156,1,buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of crapsbr br my experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of peter r unfortunatelybr br the price was excellent  i ordered mine after the date of  j robert bois positive experience  review was written but before the date of cindy s positive experience  written review  i bought these  gave them to my dad as he loves dates  i noticed when i was visiting him the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his fridge a lot longer than any other date basket i had ever ordered for himbr br finally i asked him about them  he said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but  the dates well he was wondering if he should try  eat the seeds in the center  see if they were soft because the dates themselves were hard as a rock  tasted stale  i was mortified to say the least  then he wanted to know jokingly if he had done something to make me mad  i bought these for him as his punishment  no but i had to laugh when he asked about thatbr me personally i have not tried them  i will take his word for it  br br i told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels  after a week of offering the dates  i picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away  the squirrels opossums  raccoons declined to dine on the datesbr br it seems to be hit or miss with the broadway basketeers irish st patricks dried fruit gift basket purchasebr br i will not say flat out no  do not purchase this item it is not good  that is a choice you will have to make on your own  i just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basketbr br thank goodness i caught it when it was on special  did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box  i would have been really sad thenbr br amazon as usual did a fabulous job with the shipping packaging and they arrived quickly in the time frame advertised  promisedbr br best of luck  i hope others have better experiences than my dad  i hadbr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbhwbroadway basketeers irish st patricks dried fruit gift basketa
1157,5,bought this for my mom for her birthday she was dying to open it so we could all try it it was nice and fresh and everything tasted great wish i had bought one for myself
1158,5,these dates were absolutely delicious i was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star but as i looked at all the other date reviews the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the fall timeframe i had these delivered midjanuary and must say they were quite exquisite many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party
1159,3,this tea is a new flavor of black tea by tazo its better than some other brands but not even close to being as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus which they took off the market i dont think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores
1160,4,expensive but worth it and ive tried every iced tea out there lipton is pretty good too but this is the best tetleys sux and many other iced teas like bigelow are terrible but this is great like the coffee shop
1161,5,i have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles the last thing you want is lbs of cat food the cats hate but ill be buying them more of this
1162,1,this vendor is unscrupulous she ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own she has no conscience and i would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere
1163,5,i have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles  i am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online  i have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your original barbecue sauce
1164,5,if you like soft licorice these cats arent for youbr br a perfect anisey balance of salty and sweet these little licorice kitties are perfect you pop one or several in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journeybr hard exterior lasts forever if you suck on them everlasting licorice katjesbr br very fresh super fast shopping too thank you guys
1165,3,after searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of real licorice over my favorite more about that later i decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description i have to say that i was disappointed it is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that i noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which i would charactize as modest my all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a st louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by bissingers chocolate company and they call it french long licorice it is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sickysweet candy i say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite type of licorice this is important when reading reviews and purchasing i was looking for something not americanstyle junk candy with actual licorice extract not anise chewy lasting with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtonesbr br as far a bissingers is concerned they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production it is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability i can enjoy one for at least  minutes if i dont chew these are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and i limit myself to  at a sitting for my fix okay sometimes  if it is a superb bookdbr the last time i ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thankyou for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because i do not live near one of their stores and unless i visit say st louis where it is headquartered i have to mailorderanyway i prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when i get an order  for lbs i leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off that makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference it frezes without problems so i will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up  licoricegotta have it
1166,5,very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor i love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options i will be ordering more of this one
1167,2,i dont know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough
1168,1,this was a disappointment  i use other products from this linemanufacturer on a regular basis  i bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid stevia in my purse  the first time i went to use it the liquid was a dark coloralmost blackand i had to throw out the latte i was trying to sweeten  all the manufacturers other liquid products are clear and in fact this is titled clear liquid  it must have been outdatedspoiled i had already thrown the packing out so dont know how it was dated  i tried calling the amazon supplier but the call rolled into voice mail  its not enough money to spend time followingup but it was disappointing
1169,3,cans are lined w material that contains bpa which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of timebr br   i didnt see the liner when i opened a different can from the same case  im scratching my head
1170,5,these tomatoes taste like home canned when summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next i originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet and they are incredibly low in sodium but i soon bought them for myself after i tried them just once when the local organic grocery store and then sprouts stopped carrying them i turned to amazon for a case they are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil
1171,5,the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives  generally i like to make my own sauce from scratch but this is my second choice if i am short on time  its taste good and not artificially sweet  i love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste
1172,5,these are the best canned tomatoes i have tasted they have a fresh flavor similar to homecanned this is my second time buying a set they are a little more acidicbright and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes comes with a basil leaf in each can note the  oz tins are a better value than the  oz ones
1173,4,these arent diced its just mush but i like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason but dont expect diced
1174,5,well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears she was very pleased when she opened the box than her coworker really like these gummy bears to
1175,5,i have been eating these since about  years old and are my favorite chips in the world just dont eat too many of them
1176,5,i love these chips and couldnt contain my happiness when i recieved my box love them if you love spicy foodsget these
1177,1,i ordered these lollipops for a friends wizard of oz themed shower the arrived packaged well but i noticed the box said theyre from oriental trading company  if i wanted a cheap product that i knew was low quality and from china then i would have bought them directly from their site at  for  of them however from the picture these looked well made the picture is very deceiving and so is the description they show  samecolored lollipopsmine came in a variety of colors they also gave dimentions that the lollipops were x i noticed they looked a bit small and when i measured they didnt even come to  long not any of themeven though theyre all differnet lengths  this was very disappointing since i planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops overall im very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product theyre providing to consumers
1178,1,i purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business  when they arrived it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper made in china  no way im giving these to children if they were manufactured in china following the whole poisoned pet food debacle  the fact that these are made in china needs to be highlighted much more clearly
1179,3,i ordered  lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it so i rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from michaels also a few were cracked or broken so luckily i ordered more than enough unwrapped they are so adorable
1180,5,i used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friends birthday and she got a kick out of it  she had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party  she had a great time  i dont think its possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid
1181,5,i used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter they came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows they do come in a group of such a great value i was extremely satisfied
1182,1,i purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and im not impressed at all i could have saved money by ordering them directly from oriental trading company which is clearly where they came from they look cheap and theyre not as colorful as shown in the picture the oriental trading company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken the box only has  lollipops but in the description it says theres  i would have expected that if i knew they were coming from oriental trading company but thats not in the description so i feel ripped off
1183,5,i had purchased these to go along with a candyland costume for halloween  they shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap  none of the lollipops were broken in transitbr br it turns out the costume i ordered from another seller didnt fit at all and was made of very cheap material so i couldnt even alter it to fit  since i had to return the costume i requested to return these as well  i was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back so the five stars are so the amazing servicebr br now i think well hand out the lollipops with the rest of our halloween candy which i think the kids in our neighborhood will love
1184,5,i bought these lollipops for my daughters rd birthday they are super cute and the kids loved them definitely met my expectations
1185,5,i got these for my sons rd birthday i got it because i am doing a candy station for his birthday  i wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station so this is just perfect for my idea
1186,1,these lollipops are not as pictured they came in assorted colors some really drab not the rainbow brights shown in the picture they are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap i need them for a birthday party and i was really disappointed when i received them
1187,4,being the candylover that i am i wanted to buy some cute lollipops that i could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever i felt like it for that purpose alone id give them five stars however at first lick the lollipop has a slightly off taste but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way i laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are made in china im not deaddyingsick good enough as well the text on the wrapper is fine i wasnt repulsed by it and im not afraid to share id only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eatingbr the colors are not as vivid as in the picture and the lolipops are not glazed so they do not have that shiny look that many others have none of mine came broken and they were wellwrapped im happy with my purchase and plan on eating them allminus the few that i share with friends but id try something different next time
1188,5,i used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them they arent full size but they are still sooooo cute
1189,5,bought these for a birthday and they were perfectall arrived uncracked and wrapped really well super cute and perfect for  year olds
1190,5,i ordered the lollipops for party favors at my sons st birthday party  the lollipops are  inches and i used  inch thank you stickers on them  so cute  the description states that  lollipops are included in the order  i ordered  boxes and only received  lollipops in each box  i contacted the sellers customer service  i received a response and apology right away  they promptly corrected the order  i was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of  and not just the  i expected  the lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap  out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked  not a big deal to me since i did receive an extra box  great lollipop at a great price
1191,1,i opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke i was very disappointed  they did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking  you are better off buying them from a store around your area
1192,5,comical that this is considered a toy  i bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition i used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table  lots of compliments  i have kept them and plan to use again for future parties  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste
1193,4,got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party so i havent actually tasted them the lollipops are cute    the wrappers have writing on them which i wish they didnt would have been much cuter without the writing they are a bit smaller than i expected just slightly larger than a regular lollipop and a few arrived broken but really they were well packaged and looked cute for the party
1194,5,these arrived securely packaged not even a chip on one lollipop  they also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sisters baby shower  i would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers
1195,4,anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring  we are new to the dixie carb counters line but i was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste  some of the other low carb lines like atkins have a terrible aftertaste or require the user to have a great imagination yesthis is really supposed to be a chocolate bar  but the dixie carb items are great  easy to make nice portion size great taste and no imagination required  it really is a muffin  andno sugar alcohol  my only issue is that they are a little pricey  otherwise perfect
1196,4,im going to guess that yuck didnt mix it up right because frankly these taste surprisingly good considering theyre supposed to be locarb theyre easy to make and the nondiabetic in the house thinks theyre just as tasty as i do i do agree that the price is pretty outrageous though
1197,1,this muffin mix is awfulall you taste is flour and sour creamwhich is used to make these  it just tastes wierd ive tried and triedbr there are no good tasting low carb treatsesp for diabetics
1198,5,i love salsa and have tried many on the market i served dippin fiesta at a recent sunday football get together and got rave reviews maybe the best salsa i have ever tasted and served if you want to taste the best try this one
1199,5,i spent the first five years of my life in brazil and my american parents both spoke portuguese fluently and introduced me to brazilian food and culture this is one of my favorite foods ever and the lingering memory i have of brazil fluffy moist and made out of tapioca flour these little rolls are nothing like american cheese bread seriously they arent its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven and theyre just as fabulous coldbr br yoki is the best maker of the dry mix and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy delicious treat or side dish they never turn out wrong
1200,5,i made these recently for a holiday party  i have never seen anything go so fastbr br they were very easy to make just add a few ingredients mix and throw them in the oven  i will definitely be buying and making these again
1201,5,these are not as good at houstons samba grill but they tasted great the texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis i have found something that i can make i would surely recommend these to anyonr
1202,5,since being gluten free ive tried all types of gf breads and they are all very expensive who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread its custom which is probably why they are all so skinny lol but i loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more
1203,5,my item got to my house on time and i was surprised on how well my package was packed i recommend this store to anyone
1204,3,these are tiny packets i bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not my kids love the product but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages i sent them back
1205,5,despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here see the ingredient list on the omaha site but that is not a bad thing in this case they are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious our kids just love them we serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal  piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wonderingbr br calories br br fat br br trans fat br br sodium br br carbohydrate br br protein br br for our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under  fat   carb this fits perfectly  the taste is superb baked in the oven they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside all with no grease we now keep these on hand instead of french fries i know they cost more but they taste better and they are so much healthier we wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time
1206,5,perfect year round with just about any meat dish these omaha steaks twice baked potatoes are a gourmet delight the consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor  they cook easily in either the conventional oven or on the grill when wrapped in foil  go ahead treat yourself
1207,1,for christmas i ordered some coupons from my daughters school for  off ohama steaks  i was excited to try them as i have been bombarded with their ads for the last  years and i was ready to test them out  i went online and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them  i made my choice and fell for some of the last min addons by choice  i went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time having  for  i naturally thought i was getting  off the total  with that said i was still willing to go ahead with the order   later i had ordered one of the package deals and the addons  i received my order ups in  days packaged in a styro cooler  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks  i am a person who loves to grill and do so about  nights a week so i know a little about meat and how to cook it  first this is not high end dryaged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher  the steaks are about  a pound after shipping and the high prices  the hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry  i am so disappointed in the quantity and quality i really have no words to describe how disappointed i am with this whole deal  to top everything off i received a email coupon for  off my next order so the coupon that i purchased was  more than online deals  wow do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store
1208,4,these are actually very tasty  pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler stuff  no bacon no cheesejust tasty potatoes  they cook well in either the oven or microwave  i add a touch of either salt  pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up  i rated  out of  stars because they could be a bit bigger portion  however this item is a fairly good value for the money
1209,3,these are actually pretty good little potato puffs and best of all  no cheese  unless you like that sort of thing which we dont so its nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in itbr br anyways  these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like  minutes  worth it for 
1210,4,they are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than au gratin but nevertheless yum yum yum
1211,1,not happy with the product  once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didnt look any thing like the product picture that was seen  the shipping cost as much as the potatoes did
1212,5,i love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak
1213,4,i really like this product  it tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave
1214,5,very good side dish easy to make easy to eat  as others have said needs a little spice but other than that they are delicious
1215,5,excellent  will order again  its nice to be able to order omaha items from amazon because amazon ships sooo fast and payments are so convenient
1216,5,i was surprised at the size of these potatoes i have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small these are perfect tasty cook just right love em
1217,3,these potatoes are good  but i dont know if id get them again  the garlic taste to me was off and strong  and i love garlic  hoping i just got an off batch
1218,4,excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it  but perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers a premier company hard to find anymore
1219,4,we had these along with omaha prime rib both were great two where plenty to fill up made them in toaster oven in less then  minutes
1220,4,i received  of these in my first ever omaha steaks order that i received today i wasnt sure what to expect but so far ive been pleased i tore the plastic open put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on   minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious the cheese filling was crispy ontop and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft no way would they come out as good if put in the microwave so id say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go now you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what omaha charges for these alone but as long as you get a good deal on the omaha website these simply make a great addition to any omaha steaks order as delicious are they are though i wouldnt order a box of just these off the site due to the added shipping costs but like i said as long as theyre part of a nicely priced packaged deal ill definitely take them actually i probably wouldnt order any packaged deal in the future from omaha that didnt include these a big plus at least for me is if you check the ingredients list on these theres no partially hydrogenated oils so theres no traces of trans fats which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes also no high fructose corn syrup which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus if you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example chances are the butter used sour cream etc will be full of chemicals trans fats  high fructose corn syrup these not so much so there is a definite degree of quality with omahas stuffed baked potatoes each potato does have  grams of saturated fat which is  the drv but thats obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon cheese and sour cream i was also expecting there to be no fiber but it turns out theres grams of fiber per baked potato half another plus overall the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy being made with quality ingredients
1221,5,these potatoes are really very good  my husband and i both love them  and way too easy  we will be buying more of these
1222,5,i got these in the mail today i know right sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail haha  come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags  just stick them on a baking sheet for  min at  degrees  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage your choice this get a  for taste  for presentation buy these now great price too thanks for your time and thank you omaha steaks the best at great prices
1223,4,january  br br i purchased these potatoes from omaha steaks online last week i was not sure what to expect  the au gratin potatoes i had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce and by the looks of them this certainly wasnt it  i opened the box and got out my skillet the first thing that i noticed is that these things were huge  like a gigantic tater tot i browned them on both sides about  minutes each to my surprise they were very tasty texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh  not frozen or freezer burned i liked them alot i think these are perfect for kids  none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture  i give these  stars
1224,5,so so good  delicious easy to prepare food  i would definitely order again  had a gourmet taste and took only minutes to get ready  yum
1225,4,i like em but nothing unique about the flavor  basically saves you from having to make them at home a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
1226,4,they taste pretty good i eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from omaha steaks it makes a great meal
1227,5,these potatoes are pretty good they can be eaten alone or served with a meal really like potatoes and this is an easy choice
1228,3,omaha steaks   oz stuffed baked potatoesbr  br the stuffed baked potatoes were unimpressive andbr lacking in flavorbr br i tasted no bacon or chivesbr br however they do make an attractive addition to abr meal
1229,3,potatoes were good two  oz trays will be enough for  adults so really not worth the money honestly  for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality like i said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for xmas dinner today or i wouldnt have had enough  oz of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol not omahas fault
1230,5,i prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven they are the perfect compliment to a hamburger steak or chicken entree try them youll like them
1231,5,very good transaction and omaha food was sent properly  i already left one feedback
1232,5,these potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers  i would definately recommend omaha steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price
1233,5,im a big fan of outburst energy bites and the peanut ones are probably my favorite theyre reasonably priced and a great snack think of peanut mms and a coffee all at once since they taste so good it is very tempting to eat the whole box they claim its a lot of caffeine but it doesnt feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink so i usually give in to the temptationbr br i highly recommend these
1234,5,energy bites fing rip your face off with molten lava energybr br infinity energy to the fing max  i ate a whole box once and threw a car at a babybr br fing ravebr br seriously these are great
1235,3,a  diamond would be cheaper to ship than a  car  i dont buy from any supplier that ships by pricebr this item is  then you pay  for up to  for shipping no way i would pay that for one jar
1236,1,wheres the ingredient list for this product  thought all foods were supposed to have it  would never buy any food without first knowing whats in it
1237,5,i originally found this roasted garlic juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs plants and ice cream that was about a year ago and unfortunately the place is now out of business i was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on amazon as i couldnt find anything even close at any grocery store in a mile radius store managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice i told them if they carried it they would sell a lotbr br i have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor cant be beat it is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine i prefer the roasted over the cold pressed but both are great in their own way its nice to be able to pour or spraybr br bottom line if you are a garlic lover buy this
1238,4,its a great product especially if you like garlic no need for slicing  dicing which is a good thing when your right side is stroke paralized just garlic too not an oily  salty product just plain or roasted garlic  and it lasts a long time too
1239,5,i love my garlic spray so much that i ordered more i grow garlic but i dont even bother juicing them anymore not with this product there are  cloves in every bottle thats a lot of yummy garlic
1240,5,i love the taste of real garlic  not the granulated or brined stuff these are great flavoring agents especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs love the choice between roasted and raw and a little goes a long way i first bought this product  years ago despite using one or the other at least once a week i am only now needing to replace thembr yum
1241,5,i had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since i hadnt had any since i was in arizona  it was better than i remembered  i tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good  the company delivered super fast too which was great  i recommend this tea highly particularly if you like prickly pear teas
1242,1,loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form  this tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor the shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea  if there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when i drink it it just tastes like regular black tea  very disappointing
1243,5,butternut mountain maple syrup is the real deal the grade b is wonderful on pancakes or in coffee just about on anything youd like sweetenedbr delivery was timely and the product came as expected i recommend this
1244,5,i just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product we love quotslickersquot which is what we call them instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily my daughter designed signs to be  printed in reverse to use on her car windows they printed beautifully we  have the print shop program i am going to have a lot of fun with this  product because there are windows everywhere and other surfaces like tv  screens and computer monitors
1245,5,this was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding i use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made  two thumbs up
1246,5,after years of drinking red bull rockstar monster and some others i have found the holy grail of energy drinks it kicks in within  minutes and it lasts an entire work day after seven hours or so you gradually come down there is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off you just get very sleepy when you finally restbr br redline power rush is the very best product on the market if it were illegal i would buy it on the black market nuff said
1247,5,the normal oz can is too much spam for one person  the oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches  i cut the block in half  each half i cut into  slices  the  slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast  with some salad green and nd toast it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when i hike or backpack need sodium to replace electrolyte  the nd half will become my nd sandwich if i do overnight backpacking for dinner
1248,5,our family loves spam and amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk  the ounce size is perfect for our use  amazing what you can use spam for  add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats  super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought
1249,5,its a long time since ive eaten spam but i decided to give it a try i always had left overs before but with this size can i simply enjoy every bit in one serving
1250,5,well worth the price  very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing  cant wait for amazon to get them again   january  just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when i saw the price  they were  when i purchased them in 
1251,1,so disappointed with this frosting  the first time i used this frosting i was disappointed but a year has gone by and i thought that maybe i had gotten a bad container  i really should have thought twice about buying it again but i wanted to give pillsbury the benefit of the doubt  boy was i wrong in doing that  both times that i used it the frosting pretty much sagged off of the cake  my cakes were definitely cooled  i had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers  after thawing it in the fridge i began to ice it  sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake again  this product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting the recipe needs tweaked or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together  shame on me for trying it a second time
1252,5,excellent product  crab cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during christmas holidays for over  years  local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancyminced crab meat which is ok but not as satisfatory as lump style
1253,3,i bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that i have had with canned crab i was hoping that this product was different than  previous canned crab that i have had alas it is just a little better unfortunately canned crab just seems to be not very good and i have  to stick with fresh expensive crab
1254,5,these treats are the only ones my  year old dog will eat she loves them
1255,5,she will play with it before eating it  since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her  they are expensive but less so at amazon than at a pet store
1256,5,i have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats  i dont have to worry about them choking and i feel i am giving them a healthy treat  please dont ever stop making them pet n shape
1257,5,terrific with english triffle  beware though the pack of  each of the  containers makes about a gallon of pudding
1258,5,after youve made the customary authentic english trifle with birds custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocerystore pudding packages i did purchase a large quantity of birds custard power the pack of six but the packs have a longish shelf life and i enjoyed sending a surprise packcontainer to a friend who is originally from englandbr br at christmas i will also include a container of birds custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product for my nonenglish family and friends i will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with birds custard recipe for triflebr br english trifle is so easy to make with the following  birds custard powder storebought pound cake thawed frozen fruit some sherry wine or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit poured over the small slices of cake for the final touch add nondairy whipped creme delicious and inexpensive i highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through amazon and the price for the six  containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal go for it
1259,5,we found this on our recent trip to england and had to find it as soon as we got homebr its a standard for the brits and for us now too  its been around foreverbr you can use it in so many ways pies trifle donutsbr cakes by itself with fresh fruit and whipped cream or even on french toast
1260,5,i am from england and i was raised on this custard if you like vanilla custardpudding you will love this its rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste  i love that it comes in a big canister and i can make as much as i want to i would never make a trifle with anything else
1261,5,this is a great product we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard we will purchase this product again amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage
1262,5,life without birds custard has been hell  ive tried other varietiessthg from holland if i recall correctlyjust not up to snuffi ordered  to ensure i never run out  better than ice cream and not half as fattening
1263,5,i purchased this product because i have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves  i prefer it to other powdered custardpudding products for ease of making and taste its wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price
1264,5,hard to find locally great price especially with the free shipping  have enough to share with family and friends
1265,5,this is a wonderful and very handy product  im thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used  my aunt who lived in ireland for  years said they used it all the time and loved it
1266,5,i actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose  with some slight adjustments to the recipebr br i do have one caveat about the product but its about the recipe given not the spice mix i think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use  grams is too much and you can easily use  grams instead also i think its easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken or vegetables with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while fryingbr br to make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken coconut milk for yogurt and safflower or peanut oil for gheebr br overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani ive had outside of a restaurant and even rivals some of them and the price makes this an incredible dealthere are  bags per package and there are  packages so this makes  large batches for  with free shipping i will definitely order more when i run out
1267,4,i love this tea it has a mild flavor and no caffeine the only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water this doesnt happen once in a while it happens nearly every timebr br triple leaf tea please fix this bag issue its frustrating to the point where i may look for a similar tea from another company
1268,5,anytime i have started to get even the slightest sore throat i drink this and the next morning its gone i always bought it at world market but they said it has been discontinued but thank god for amazon
1269,5,this tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too  make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say  it really seems to help you to feel better
1270,5,a friend sent me two boxes of this for christmas  i thought it an odd gift as i can just go out and buy herbal tea  shortly thereafter i was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis i started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked  not only that during this time other family members got physically ill but i was able to carry on without catching the bug  since then im a believer  i make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed
1271,5,in cold weather i brew this tea by the pot keep it simmering and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea by the cup made with this as the base  my husband will drink it and i cant get him to use any other medicinal  hates licorise  it helped a great deal last winter
1272,5,have bought this from the folks who prepare it and i must say this is the absolute best item i have ever tasted they make this at a farm in benson az and it tastes like heaven highly recommend it for everythingi tend to slice up apples and dip them have tried it on toast as well
1273,5,ive been feeding liver biscotti for years i was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog additives can be a seizure trigger and liver biscotti filled the bill the ingredients are topquality the bitesize bits are perfect for training and dont muck up your pockets the bitesize portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds which is a problem with other treats  and for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities there is an antiallergenic recipe enthusiastically recommended
1274,4,this is an excellent training treat for every day  its not a high value treat used for more challenging training situations nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive  its a good size though it does make some crumbs  plus liver biscotti is fun to say
1275,5,my  dogs love this treat  when my oldest male was younger he would sit down stand up go down roll over etc and do every trick in his repertoire before i even gave him a command whenever i pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti  my female also loves this but shes a little less silly  also this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions  i finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk ie  lbs bags since i was going to the store all the time to buy more of these  i also stuff their kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it i highly recommend this treat
1276,5,five of my five dogs agree  theyd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else  i pull out a treat and they come running  it cheers em up encourages them to obey lets em know i love em and got me over some really rough training spots with my  pound puppy  and in a few instances when ive been slow producing the goodie theyve cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves  i think its a hit
1277,5,our dog loves these treats  we sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can  we also use them as rewards for good behavior  wonderful nutritious really good to have on hand at all times
1278,5,lucy loves these treats as does her friend daisy  i do not know what else to say to fill up the  word minimum
1279,5,my dog will do anything for these treats buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever
1280,5,despite what many say and think about bulldogs ours are picky about their snacks  they love the liver biscotti which can be a handfed treat or used in a treat ball  they last longer than most snacks and because our bullies dont often chew their food these are the perfect size  i dont feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers
1281,5,our dog named big red loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was  miles round trip i am not too keen on driving that far so i found your mail service on the internet now our  pound poodle gets his treats again
1282,5,theyre perfect training treats for my dogs  they go to the place where theyre stored and stand there until i get a handful for our play games
1283,5,even my vet approves these little treats are my dogs favorite i just get the small ones because i have a small dog
1284,5,my dogs go crazy over liver biscottis they are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome
1285,5,my dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for liver biscotti even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff
1286,5,if there is one thing our dog likes it is the liver biscotti dog treats  these make the best rewards and training treats we have used
1287,5,as another reviewer mentioned these treats are crunchy i like them for  reasonsmy dog cant just woof them down she has to chew them so they lastand i like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth the treats are small but again are crunchyim glad i found these she loves them and i like giving them to her
1288,5,i have two dogs that absolutely love these treats  the lb bag size that i purchased is very convenient and long lasting  the vendor that i purchased them from is very thorough several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and its upcoming delivery the price was extremely reasonable  the best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day  a guilt free doggie reward
1289,5,our portuguese water dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats he loves them and will do anything for them  good dog
1290,4,i dont mind paying a lot for a quality treat for my dogs as these are but i have a real problem in companies who price gouge on shipping charges  its obviously not enough for them to get the amount of money which is high for the treats themselves they have to also make money off me for shipping charges  there is no way that it cost them  to ship a lb bag of treats to me   dollars would be fair and accurate this is the reason i gave it only  stars instead of 
1291,5,our four dogs love this stuff this bite size treat is a perfect size for training the dogs like the crunch  its shaped like a small square crouton there is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs
1292,5,the ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes  our dogs are absolutely crazy for liver biscotti  we love the size of this treat it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding  the size is also great for using as bait for conformation showingbr br we love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used  all you have to do is open the bag and smell whats inside  it smells so good you might be tempted to try one toobr br we love the  pound bag  having multiple dogs this bag really is a cost saver  youll see significant savings over buying the small oz bagsbr br it also makes a great gift for your dog lovingowning friends spread the joy of liver biscotti
1293,5,a fantastic product for pet treatsgreat smell and has freezedried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds owner of  fussy cockers
1294,1,this was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbsbr maybe my dog is just spoiled but she treats these like third class treats it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy  more often than not she will simply walk away from these  glad other people like them but i will not be buying them again
1295,5,omg these things are delicious im not a candysweets eater usually but  ohman i liked them so much i may have had  two oops now three
1296,5,i was just messing around on amazon when i ran into this add for beer nuts when i noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny being the beer lover that i am i had to try them  well theyre here now and i cant drink beer without them they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the s and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america  iican see why theyre pretty darn good
1297,5,i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid  sorta like honey roasted peanuts but more unique flavor  if you never triedem if you like honey roasted peanuts youll love these
1298,5,great product wish they were still available in barspubsand storeshave given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me im just glad they are still available on line
1299,5,some reviewers must have a short memory ive been eating beer nuts since childhood and the ones i ordered tasted like they always have sweet and salty bought them locally until i couldnt find them anymore great product and price for oz cans
1300,4,after a second purchase of a oz beer nuts peanuts pack i can level no complaints the shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middleager nonetheless everyone i know who has tried this product likes it  either as a standalone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers beer nuts is a tasty if understated winner
1301,5,this is the second time ordering beer nutsi can not find them anywhere in local stores  the shipment came  cans per order and  cans were damaged  called amazon customer service and the next day another  cans appeared at my doorbr br the nuts are always great unless can is damaged and nuts are stale but the customer service was the shining star  thank you   will order again
1302,5,my husband is a beer nut lover looked in many storesbr and could only find small bags love these large cans
1303,4,i am  years old and i have eaten these nuts for many years  the ones mailed to me are very tastey  the only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can  no big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts  i will order from amazon again
1304,5,not always available at our local stores i love them they are especially good watching football games with you favorite malt beverage this is a good deal and super fast delivery too the nuts were fresh and tasty as always
1305,5,these are the long time classic  not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew  amazons price on these is really great
1306,2,i remember well the beer nuts i used to savor those were the days of the big redskin type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang i remember so well these nuts i now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of beer nuts in any way yes there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real plus these nuts are simply the common inexpensive spanish peanuts in short i would just ask beer nuts  what happened
1307,1,i ate beer nuts all through my childhood years and into my s after that you couldnt buy them in upstate ny when a great friend of mine said he was looking for them i checked out the net to find them on your sitebr they are horrible what a dissapointment they taste more like spanish peanuts with out the salt the beer nuts i remember where sweet and salty just like the label says these peanuts are bland bland bland
1308,1,the flavor of the old beer nuts is almost entirely gone the beer nuts are now just plain spanish peanuts with a slight flavor hardly noticeable extremely disappointing
1309,1,it is not the best way to buy beer nutsbr br perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a whole lot of shaking  most of the coating and flavoring was off of the nuts  even though the individual cans are sealed it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot humid day
1310,5,this is the good stuff i am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce this pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely its colorful and tasty and is great al dente
1311,5,all of the castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful  they have a great taste hold their unique shapes grab lots of sauce in your dishes and have a nice bite  this is a great price for this item
1312,5,br br oh i love this pasta it is thick chewy absolutely extraordinary and made with authentic flavorings to boot the red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder the green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder the black pastas are flavored with squid ink the offwhite are au naturale the yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric the orange with carrot powder a rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavorbr br the pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use because this pasta is so very flavorful i enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some celtic sea salt sometimes i add some tarragon or fresh rosemary usually not so i can just savor the pasta alone it also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated parmesan chees on topbr br with only g of fat g of sodium this can also be a hearthealthy meal there are g of protein and g of carbos no added sugars or preservativesbr br it is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a datebr br to be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at half price in bulk from amazon is a wonderful privilege you will not be disappointedbr br 
1313,5,yes its expensive but its worth it  i have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one  add some crushed garlic sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose i prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb for two days  you wont believe the oohs and aahhhs you get at the tableworth every penny
1314,5,its not a traditional bbq sauce in terms of flavor but you could easily use it for that its very thick and has a strong hotness not too hot  but hotter than most spicy bbq sauce and its made from much better ingredients than most bbq or sweet hot sauces it tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet it would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried and its incredible in pork and beans dont let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment
1315,5,its always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them  its great to know that you can send someone  some chocolates with the guarantee that they dont arrive all melted  good service and excellent chocolates
1316,5,we love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type  so glad we found this at amazon  it is wonderful
1317,5,best dipping chocolate ever i dipped strawberries pretzels marshmallows its wonderful my whole family loves them great to bring out to friends or occasions dont forget the wax paper otherwise it will stick to your plate
1318,1,the current product certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador sold by saaqin is of terrible quality somehow reviews for a similar item produced by alive and aware were associated with this product the cocoa i received when ordering through this page is made by organic herbal essence alive and aware is delicious organic herbal essence is not another warning after receiving the lb bag of organic herbal essence and hating it i ordered alive and aware certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador   pounds shipped by halaleveryday i thought for sure id get alive and aware given its in the product title but halaleveryday actually shipped me organic herbal essence grr
1319,5,i have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones  the richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder  it is just a better product
1320,4,i use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks  with the high price of cocoa on the commodity market this is an excellent price especially for an organic product  the cocoa is less tasty than my regular brand but does very well for the price  my main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with no label  i would like to see an organic label as well as the nutrition info for the product
1321,1,as another reviewer stated many of the reviews for this product are actually for a different raw cacao powder from alive and aware ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder that is what i ordered about  months ago and it was awesome i am almost out and when i went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product from saquin which is not what i ordered and it is more expensive the same base price but i got it with free shipping not  bucks so that is a big price increase  i know it was still from alive and aware midfebruary but recently something changedbr i am really confusedirritated how my review for alive and aware raw cacao got switched to a different brand from a different seller i mean cant they just say out of stock or currently unavailable like they do with other stuff why would they switch reviews aroundbr seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one especially since as the other reviewer stated they are not comparable and this stuff from saquin is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware also the price increase is pretty shocking i guess it is the market and raw cacao is in higher demand too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacaobr i did recently order alive and awares raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those they are as the description states from alive and aware not another brandbr frankly i am beginning to wonder about some of the brands and vendors that ship from amazon i know they have warehouses in different parts of the country but it is a little suspicious and i just wish there was more transparency about what comes from amazon and what comes from a different company seems like halal everyday alive and aware etc are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleverydaysaquin are these really different companies under the auspices of amazon or is it amazon by a different name only like the other reviewer said he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquinhalal everyday  who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazonbr br for now i am going to seek out another source not through amazon that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me for health benefits and the ecologicalsocial impacts of where it is harvested to know that i am getting topnotch certified organic raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishywashy and sneaky im going elsewhere wagging finger at amazonbr br i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it backbr br heavens to besty this stuff rocks it is such a good value too maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around  i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder and this is certainly topnotch  kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable pricebr i am not a raw foodie per say but i try to follow a neopaleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao  properly prepared with just enough natural sweetener i think this is a truly guiltfree pleasure  it is loaded with antioxidants as you probably know  so go ahead get the big bag  you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods theobroma as they say br my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so its not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible i know its not  raw  but hey this is how i love it add just enough sweetener i like sorghum molasses a scant tspoon a bit of maca powder a dash of real salt and after thats thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm i have converted everyone even the kids i babysit who used to prefer swiss miss or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk lightly sweetened  you better believe it goes fast  i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot  plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happybr also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil  i often toss in soakeddried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so its kind of homogenous like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or rawbr go for it buy this huge bag share the goodness and youll be healthier and happier for it i guarantee  peace be with you
1322,5,this cocoa powder has a deep fruity taste i highly recommend it  i recently bought a vitamix blender which means that i now make  smoothies a day  this cocoa powder plus some almond milk frozen fruit yogurt and a dash of maple syrup makes an excellent milk shake  disclaimer i like  of all chocolate so take this positive review with a grain of salt
1323,5,almost identical to ghiradelis great chocolate tastebut raworganic the best i also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with strvia and make ballsnacks from it yummmm
1324,5,this was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and i was pleasantly surprised  the item was packed and shipped professionally and i love the resealable bag  i initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and i didnt taste anything  i then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetablefruit juice which normally tastes like bananas  i was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake  this is one of the best deals youll find online on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great  this is one of the healthiest foods in the world and i recommend this seller if youre looking to purchase it
1325,5,raw cacao powder differs greatly in taste than processed cacao powder commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor commercial cacao powder is mono tonal in flavor raw cacao is everything that commercial cacao isnt it is a antioxidant superfood which has no equal the taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next as to taste it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of mahogany in foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao in baking i believe it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract your icing will have no equal in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake the acid helps to unify and amplify flavors i like making cake with  cake flour which is about has about  wheat gluten and  rice flour the reason for this should be obvious the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enoughbr br raw cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown to inhibit lowdensity lipoprotein ldl oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma highdensity lipoprotein hdl and decreases ldl levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens
1326,1,this product described as organic raw cacao powder from peru is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder i have had  the taste of this product is definitely not as good  this product has a bitter muddy thin taste as compared to the fuller richer taste of the real thing from other vendors  as soon as i tasted this product which is destined for the trash bag i understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors  it is nowhere near as good  spend a few dollars more and get the real thing
1327,5,this powder and this company are both superb there was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that i will be a customer forever
1328,5,this is a very tasty cacao powder  it arrived in an unmarked bag does not have an organic symbol or product description but it seems to be the real deal  good flavor similar to or better than name brand powders i have purchased in the past  will definitely purchase again
1329,5,bought as gift for hard to buy for fatherhe loved  bread said it was delicious 
1330,5,wonderful productbr br all the bread mixes i have tried on amazon are not disappointingbr br will be back for more  they will make great christmas presents
1331,5,i figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be  this is it  if you are of a certain age over  or  you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon this cannot be found in store bacon anymore  modern bacon is thin lightlypoorly smoked  even the socalled gourmet bacon  this is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the good old days  arrives nice and cool in an ice pack  cheaper if you buy the pack
1332,5,love this dont use too much because it is strong but it tastes great  makes even mediocre salmon taste great
1333,5,these are thincrisp fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty they are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea my choices if you like ginger snaps you will love lars ginger snaps
1334,5,these ginger cookies are iti dont have to look anymore i have found the cookie i ate the entire box and did not shareso hubby said when i order more i have to get  boxes cause he would like to have some
1335,5,very good  very tasty and authentic flavor  i ordered these last minute for christmas not knowing if they were going to arrive on time  they arrived at my house on christmas eve
1336,5,didnt have time to make these this year so i thought i would buy them i never buy cookies but these i would buy again my son loved them the only thing i had to do was dip them in white chocolatebr thanks
1337,2,ya know when youre on a glutenfree diet you yearn for those forbidden treats  like licorice and malted milk realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future we need to alter our expectations for this treatbr br i had tried this companys raspberry laces and strawberry laces  pretty good although not easy to chew think bubblegum  not real licorice you understand but pretty doggone good as an alternativebr br so i thought i try these too  how bad could they be  i found them pleasant to chew  not tough at all  but the taste  nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awfulbr br so im stuck with  packsbr br see if you cant find a source where you can buy just one pack to try out  your tastes may be different than mine and you might enjoy them
1338,5,after finding out two of our family members have celiac disease we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs  candy trees organic cherry bites have no sugar and truly rival the cherry nibs with gluten  after a year of not having the real thing my husband believes candy trees are actually better
1339,5,this licorice has very good taste  my daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites
1340,3,maybe these a better when theyre very fresh  you could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these  they taste great
1341,4,wowthis was the first licorice id had in two years after being diagnosed with celiac disease  that was one of the hardest things to give up  these are nicenot exactly like the real thing but close enough  there are many companies that call their product licorice but they are merely ripoffs of dots candy ie nothing like real licoricevery gooey and stick to your teeth  these are quite firm more like older licorice but still a great chew  it satisfied me and my craving for real licorice
1342,4,gluten free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to regular foods this licorice follows that trend for the times when youd like to treat yourself candy tree organic licorice is a tasty and safe treat for gluten intolerant people amazon seems to have the best prices on it too
1343,5,this dressing became an instant favorite of mine  its fat free without losing the flavor  alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions and that only makes you have to use twice as much  wish bone is now my only choice for ranch dressing  my husband doesnt usually go for fat free or diet anything but i put this on our salads and he didnt even know
1344,5,if i had not purchased this salad dressing myself i never would have guessed it was fat free served it with fresh vegetables during thanksgiving predinner and it was a definite hit with the guests too
1345,5,like the flavor and its thick unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny
1346,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbodryiwish bone fat free ranch salad dressing ounce bottle pack of abr br this is a great salad dressingtastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular fatfull dressing
1347,5,the price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost  dont know why the price on this has gone up though
1348,5,my doc has strictly limited me on what i can and cannot eat i can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price good taste
1349,1,i bought this for my husband since he loves ranch he uses ranch dressing with everything before i bought it i read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fatfree well my husband had it and says its aweful i guess to each his own everyones tastebuds are not alike  someone else may like it so i am not going to discourage anyone from trying it however i had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes ranch in the family doesnt like this one i guess he needs the fat
1350,5,want to taste something different  then you are coming to the right place  i just love the smoothness  and flavor of the ranch dressingnow get on your horses or mules and order some today
1351,5,this is a very smooth tea from argo tea  i was so excited when they came to nyc and i bought a bag of this tea to make at home  it has an almondychocolatey flavor but not overpowering  its a great tea for everyone including people just starting to drink tea  i love it in a latte i just microwave some milk and use that instead of water
1352,5,if you like jasmine tea this is a great tea its lite not overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl i steep it so many times that until i lost count haha just great 
1353,5,we received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up  great biscuits and now i am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people i cant figure out what to get
1354,3,i sent this product to my brother in law so i have never seen the product and know nothing about it  all i heard from him was that he was not impressed  other than that i can say that it was delivered  i ordered two of these going to different addresses and we got immediate feedback on the first one but until we spoke to my brother in law we had no idea if the product had even been shipped  would i order again  probably notbr br thanks anywaybr curt u
1355,5,of all the flavors of tic tacs these are my favorite  great wild cherry flavor love them too bad they arent more readily available to purchase locally
1356,5,these little buggers are tough to find so i was happy to get a big pack at a good price online  my daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at  calories a piece not all that unhealthy
1357,5,definitely would reorder these again  i think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack  my kids love these  great little valentines day gifts  great stocking stuffers
1358,5,i bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and theyre hard to find i kept half for myself i admit gone in no time
1359,5,everyone knows what a tic tac is but let me tell you something if you like orange tic tacs youre going to love wild cherry tic tacs  very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour  do yourself a favor and try some
1360,5,i love these wild cherry tic tacs and they are impossible to find in stores  i am so glad that i can get them from amazon and the price is excellent  they are a great low calorie treat and i will keep buying them from amazon  highly recommend this purchase
1361,4,i low orange tictacs and after reading reviews i decided to try these and there almost just as good orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close
1362,5,these are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs  the flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense  you really get a lot of flavor out of one calorie treat which can satisfy for quite a while
1363,5,great thanks for the great service i dont know what else to say i have said all i have tu say
1364,4,since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago he took up the tictac habit with cinnamon tictacs  they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are ok
1365,5,very nice productbr full of quality items  not the cheap candies like other baskets
1366,5,were just what my wife wanted and she loves them next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor
1367,5,i love sorghum flour  its mild in flavor and smell its easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too  its one of my favorites along with millet sweet rice coconut and almond
1368,5,i buy most of my flours from bobs red mill in the pack boxes if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them  its good flour and the bags a good size for baking for a small family  also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it
1369,5,my sister is alergic to wheat so i make her a lot of gluten free foods  i searched local stores and could not find sorghum flour  so i looked on amazon and finally found it  it was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and im already using it
1370,5,i love baking with the bobs red mill sweet white sorghum flour i use it in many things but i tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as cakes and muffins i make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for i would highly recommend this flour to any baker even more for the glutenintolerant ones i use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour it always turns out fantastic
1371,5,i am a big fan of sorghum flour for my baked goods it gives everything a bit of sponge especially cakes and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking i highly recommend this for baking flour mixes  you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor
1372,4,spectrum naturals walnut oil refined is a very mild oil i cant detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all maybe thats what you want in some cases though i was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnutsbr br it does have the advantage of having higher omega  content than most oils also most oils that are high in omega  like fish oil and flax oil have a strong taste which you probably dont want on your saladbr br unlike some of spectrums oils it is not organic
1373,5,great productbr br the stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all naturalbr br use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugarbr br tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener
1374,5,i have recently been on a low carb diet as i find that i can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave honey and dates these raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin a hormone whose message is store fat insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore i would bloat from a high carb dietbr br my dilemma is that i love sweetsand now it is not a problem thanks to products like stevia a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years it has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar although for some people there might be a bit as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar stevia used to be legal in the usa only as a cosmetic product because of politics companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition yet aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis so i would use stevia at times but the aftertaste was badand to be honest i wasnt too crazy about the during taste eitherbr br then i tried nunaturals this product is awesome and like no other stevia i have tried it is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste unless you put in way too mucha common mistake by people new to this it comes in tablets and in powdered form in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings it also comes in alcoholfree liquid form and even in vanilla flavor unlike aspartame which becomes even more toxic when heated stevia can be used in baking nunaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that since i am a raw fooder i cant tell you how it tastes but i am sure it is good judging by their other productsbr br thanks to these great products i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets
1375,3,i have mixed feelings about nunaturals nustevia white stevia with maltodextrin powder and will probably not purchase it again  dont get me wrong its a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use but it is just  percent stevia and  percent maltodextrin filler  in other words only  pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder  in my opinion this is unnecessarily dilute however it does make it exceptionally easy to measure  if the labeling said  stevia extract i would have passed on this from the beginning as i can get  dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia if this is your first time buying stevia go for it as its easy to use and tastes great  if youre accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this products mixturebr br prosbr  star tastebr  easy to measurebr  perfect for firsttime stevia usersbr   tsp   tbsp cane sugarbr br consbr  only  steviabr  not costcompetitive with  or pure dry stevia extractsbr   tsp   tbsp cane sugarbr br overall a good product but not the best value  i would given it  stars if the product labeling didnt try to hide the fact that its just not very potent  for about  to  the cost of this product you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a lowcost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead or just use them full strength which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure steviabr br in case youre wondering where i got the  by mass value from this is how i calculated it  on a precise scale i found the density of this product to be  grams per teaspoon  the label says it contains mg per  tsp  thus  tsp has mg stevia extract in mg mixed powder  the concentration mass comes to mg stevia per gram of product or  percent by weight  pretty weak stuff but still much sweeter than cane sugar
1376,5,i used to use agave nectar and honey even though i picked organic there was still more sugar than desired after i put in my recipes i actually got tinea versicolor due to the sugars in those productsbr br but this product is great i use it in my protein shakes smoothies and baking recipes muffins breads and its awesomebr br i make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edgesbr  cottage cheesebr  chocolate protein powderbr  cacao powderbr  almond milkbr  nustevia powderbr br just need maybe  cup of each ingredient and  cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake
1377,5,this is the best tasting stevia powder ive tried most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesnt i recently bought a lb bag of it online and im making my way through it
1378,5,cutting sugar out of our dietwe went to splenda then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry we went to stevia no calorie powder after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects the trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste i also found that using a stevia that has an  ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that i have found because of using very small amounts this jar lasts for months this is also the best price anywhere swanson is a trusted vendor as is amazon
1379,5,i am hooked on stevia not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetnerbr br of all the brands i have tried nunaturals is the best it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter tastebr br i keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when i eat out i use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies and this is large  oz jar the best size for use at home i keep a  tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it outbr br i have given up all artificial sweetners i no longer drink diet coke and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splendabr br if you have not used stevia before i urge you to try it if you have used other brands and did not like them try nustevia and you will be impressed
1380,5,this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried  i also think this is a better value than some of the others  i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea
1381,5,if you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea you can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the stevia powderbr br unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is never bitter and wont leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth the packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foodsbr br by using a low calorie  calories sweetener with only  gram of carbs you will be ahead of the game every single time you use one packet of stevia you are using less sugar and you wont even miss itbr br the rebecca review
1382,1,this was my favorite stevia product and i had it on subscribe and save until i queried customer service about nunaturals gmo use  yes nunaturals uses gmo products  so ive canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbellustevita stevia clear liquid extract ounce container pack of a
1383,3,maybe my tastebuds are different but i bought this at a local healthfood store and im not completely sold on it  i tried it in my tea and it did leave me w an aftertastejust like most sweetners shrugs
1384,5,i hated stevia and its licorice taste until i tried nustevia  since that day i have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks  i like that it is a plant based product and not bioengineered  no aftertaste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet
1385,5,i dont like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they dont taste good i am a caregiver for my diabetic dad and once i discovered this product i was hooked except that it is hard to find where i live when i found it at amazon i put it on auto ship so i dont run out  the price has gone up a lot since i first found it on amazon however it still costs more in stores if and when i can find it there i make limeade with this which i keep on hand at all times in a gallon container of water i add  cup of lime juice and tbsp of stevia powder it is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste  my dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal i havent tried cooking with it although i know they make one designed for baking which ill possibly try this winter
1386,4,i bought the nunaturals white stevia with maltodextrin several months ago as im trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners the first morning i tried it in my coffee and hated it it tastes just as bitter as equal or sweet n low i decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious ive also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea so i think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia all in all im glad i bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go i have tried many different brands of stevia but so far this is the only one i have not thrown out i also tried truvia not a fan it makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice
1387,5,if you are trying to get off sugar this is the product for you i has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin and no bitter aftertaste  great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy  i love this product
1388,5,i have tried various brands of stevia but i always come back to nunaturals  i buy the  ounce container because i use it to sweeten everything  if you have a sweet tooth as i do but dont need the added pounds then this is the ticket for you  i drink a lot of tea and this is my sweetener  a lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste but this is the best that i have found to resolve that problem  highly recommended
1389,5,if you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go i love stevia in my iced tea and its great on your cereal also great stuff
1390,5,i started using nustevia several years ago  back then i had to purchase it from a health food store  thanks to amazon i can now order and have it within a few days  i never run out  as for the product its the best  ive tried several stevia products but they have an after taste  not with nustevia  please try if you havent
1391,5,i was looking for a healthier alternative to splenda and equal nustevia taste great and this container lasts a long time
1392,5,stevia is pretty much the only natural zerocalorie sweetener there is but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter  not nustevia  nustevia has absolutely no bitterness and tastes exactly like real sugar  its amazing  add it to plain yogurt you have an amazing guiltfree dessert breakfast side dish snack  add it to tea coffee recipes anything  it is a truly magical product and it is cheaper in the  oz container on amazon than anywhere else  they also sell it at gnc but it is  for  oz  also for drinks i highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages it eventually does dissolve though
1393,4,after years of using synthetic sweeteners like equal and sweet n low i realized their longterm effects and wanted to find a good alternative nustevia was a lucky discovery it has virtually no bitter aftertase its all natural and ive been using it exclusively for more than a year now it works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portabilityi havent used it for baking and probably wont because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect however for daily use in beverages this product is very good
1394,5,i was quite skeptical about stevia at first but tried it with another brand and thought there wasnt much difference in taste and i felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there i then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product i now have purchased this same product  times and am quite pleased the product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitorsbr br the deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging
1395,5,we love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything beverages desserts cooking it is not at all bitter even in hot drinks like coffee for baking there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar  if you need to replace the bulk of sugar in a recipe you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work  my kids dont notice the switch and i feel good about using it because its all natural
1396,5,i am so happy i discovered this product i had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and nunaturals is by far the best virtually no aftertaste quick dissolving and convenient it is also very economical at  cents a serving i use a  teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder  youll be happy you did
1397,5,i discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee  tea and on fruit and oatmeal  it was a lot less expensive in the packets then but ive switched to the large  oz container and the price is very good i dont use sugar and this helps me have the sweet and not the increased blood sugaryeah
1398,5,i love this stevia i have tried many different kinds over the years and this one is my fave goes great in my coffee and tea i have this one on auto ship and get one a month makes it pretty cheap too
1399,5,i have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is hands down the very best out there  i use nunaturals nustevia for all sweetening purposes  it can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium  i was delighted to find it on amazoncom for a very reasonable price even less when obtained through a standing order
1400,5,this stevia is the best tasting weve ever tried it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some othersthe service from this buyer was prompt the product arrived on time and in excellent condition would order from them again and recommend them to otherslinda blyth
1401,5,i ordered this after having much success with their liquid products it is not bitter at all and has a very freshclean taste to it  i have baked with it used it on the stove and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa  when i run out ill be ordering more
1402,5,nunaturals stevia is the only sweetener that i use in my beverages and cooking i have tried other brands and this one is the best it hasnt any odd taste and tastes better than sugar to me i buy the large  ounce container and it lasts me for months i only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores there is a soda that has stevia in it that i purchase at a health food store called virgils zero and it comes in different flavorsit is great and i dont have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas this product is great and i think is the best of stevia products on the market
1403,5,i find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands vs usingopening sweetener packets  this product works well both in cold  hot things like homemade lemonade  in coffee  easy to open lid product dissolves more easily in cold liquids than many other types of stevia
1404,5,i used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in florida for  dollars where i moved to in ny i could not find it in the stores so i looked online with shipping costs it still cost under  dollarsbr br i use this product in tea and coffee and i like it better than real sugar i dont find it bitter at all even when i accidently put a little too much in ice tea sometimes i forget its not real sugar when its in ice tea i especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste i have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good
1405,4,nustevias white stevia powder is amazing  i have been on a lowcarb diet for the last year and have lost  lbs and nustevia products were a big help with the success of my diet  i love sweet things and without them i dont think id have been able to stay on the lowcarb diet  i have been unable to eat sugar for a long long while  i had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave but when i discovered they were not on the lowcarb diet id switched to i had to find something else to use as a substitute  nustevia products are what i chose  i tried several other types of stevia but nustevia products seem to be the best so far  the bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from nustevia productsbr nustevia white stevia powder is super sweet so youll have to use it sparingly and one bottle lasts a very long timebr im very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again
1406,5,the first time i tried this product  was  years ago at the venetian spa restaurant in las vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends we all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea  weve been using it ever since a little goes a long way and i use it anytime i would ordinarily use a sweetener  since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and i have a sweet tooth i felt this was a safe alternative not only is it safer but theres no aftertaste and doesnt raise your blood sugar level this particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it ive tried others before and since and theres no comparison
1407,5,very happy with the product in a taste test for the price it ranks very high  delivery was prompt and as expected
1408,5,love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank
1409,5,roland red lumpfish caviar is excellentthe price is good and affordableit makes a good presentation for company and tastes very good i purchased many items from amazon even large ticket items and i am very satisfied with the products and service
1410,1,i bought this  pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays the other night i decided to go ahead and use one for some dip it was so bad i couldnt believe it it wasnt spoiled it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste it didnt even taste like caviar i threw the jar away
1411,3,this stuff isnt bad at all but you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything this roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes morning eggs or a caesar salad all in all for the price its pretty good
1412,3,i use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes and this brand is as good as any ive found though the red coloring is perhaps a little much
1413,1,i ordered this for gifts around christmas time i actually was hoping to use it for our christmas day meal two out of the four jars i ordered were rotten and inedible i never did get to try it and i was very annoyed and disappointed
1414,2,this stuff sounded perfectway too much red dye and no taste according to me and my  friends who tried itkind of salty  basically i would stay away from it  i am tempted to toss it out but paid too much to feel right about it
1415,5,because they brought bagels to america without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar  caviar for breakfast  we use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee  this is is best done on a week end so it can be savored ever so slowlyno stress involvedpure luxury  yes yes yes yes yes
1416,5,not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance since it wasnt that expensive  i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar  i put this stuff on just about anything i could and it was amazing  i dont know too much about caviar but for this price i dont think anybody can complain
1417,5,this is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes  with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top soooooo tasty and pretty for christmas thanks for offering it
1418,2,caviar taste awful maybe its because i bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it why do people like to waste money on these things
1419,5,all of the roland products are top quality  rolands caviar is the real deal unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed
1420,5,if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your familyi give this  stars
1421,5,cooked in healthy coconut oil thats why it stays crunchy will not give you side effects of vegetable oil  oxidized cholesterol transfats rancidity and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil
1422,3,thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but i was mistaken  these pops are about  inches long and a little less than  inch wide  flavors are comparable to flavorice not necessarily better  my wife and i enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months  glad we can get them via amazon these were on sale for  per box of  with free shipping so i think we got a good value  without the sale pricing im not sure if wed choose these over another brand but if they do go on sale again we would probably buy them again  not bad just a little small  eat two  
1423,4,these are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat superior flavor and size than the flavorice case
1424,4,we first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in costa rica while on vacation  we bought a few bags and brought them back home with us  costa rica grows arabica coffee beans fantastic  we enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning its strong flavorful full bodied and not bitter  in our  cup drip coffee maker we use two rounded scoops about  tbs  when we finished the last of the coffee we looked on amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in costa rica  we bought four bags and will be getting more
1425,5,forget starbucks peets or anything else this is the real deal like a good vintage wine britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste i am really fussy about coffee and generally avoid it but after a trip to costa rica fell in love with the beverage again you have to use a french press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions your beans deserve the best your taste buds deserve the best too no i dont work for britt and did not get paid to say this  but if you guys at britt read this send me a sample or two
1426,5,this  coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee i have ever tastedand it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner
1427,5,i love this coffee like the other reviewers i took a trip to costa rica and was immediately addicted to this bold flavorful coffee i am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that britt is handsdown the best ive ever had i brought back one bag from costa rica and have started ordering my supply because i cant go back to other bland storebought coffees definitely worth a try you wont be disappointed
1428,5,this coffee is delicious it is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste my dad told me about it after a trip to costa rica
1429,5,my husband and i took a vacation to costa rica and had a wonderful time  the whole time we were there we drank there britt dark roast and loved the taste  there was no bitter after taste plus i normally drink decaf and noticed with the britt regular dark roast it didnt bother me at all i dont have to order decaf anymore and can enjoy the regular i now order it on line and find it to be the best tasting coffee ive ever hadbr thanks for growing the best coffee beans in the world
1430,5,great tasting coffiee one of the best ive ever had the problem here is the high shipping costs
1431,5,my husband and i fell in love with cafe britt coffee while we were in costa rica  upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazoncom  the coffee is easy to drink  not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day  highly recommended
1432,4,i used to use this coffee after we visited costa rica and gave some to my aunt  she thinks it is the best coffee there is so i gave her some for christmas  it is excellent
1433,5,i first tried britt dark roast when i was in costa rica  it has a lot of rich flavor but it is not bitter at all  ive boughtbr it by the case ever since  its really no more expensive than those gourmet brands you find at your local store  this isbr simply the best coffee ive ever had and ive tried many supposedly special ones over the years
1434,1,i would never have ordered this had i known i was only going to be sent  and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out i complained to amazon and i know from experience that they always have awesome customer service since i just got my package today and just opened it now i have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issuewill keep you updated i just wanted you guys to know that even though it states  packets it is not must be a misprint double check with amazon before you order this what sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only  of them
1435,5,i used super gold luster dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the grooms cake at my sons wedding by using an artists paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with luster dust the result was startlingly beautiful in contrast to food coloring the luster dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen the containers are small but the product goes a long way making it extremely economical to use a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductthe step dynamic a powerful strategy for successfully growing your businessa
1436,5,i have used this product multiple times  in fact i purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust  each five years ago and i am just now running out  i use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for renaissance themed banquets  including gilding an entire roast duck and then using vodka painting filigree designs onto it  the clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful  i cant recommend this stuff enough
1437,4,i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust never thought i would find it but im glad i did when i sprinkled it on it looked  like a shining star the container is small but it will go a long way worth buying
1438,5,this product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings  the fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but show off  people are amazed that this is edible gold
1439,1,i found this product doing a search for edible gold leaf i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it however it is clearly marked not to be consumed and for decorative use only so this is a misleading product
1440,3,are you familiar with the hormel compleats line  if so put this one in the middle of the pack  its not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballsnoodles in cream sauce  its better than the horribly tastefree chickendressing  about even with the turkey  is that all ive tried  i forget but you get the point  its mediumcompleatbr br are you just thinking about trying a hormel compleat for the first time  ok then just remember these reviews on amazon  particularly food reviews  are all simply opinions of customers no scientific analysis intended i hopebr br compleats are quick easy except for pulling the plastic off the top and generally edible  theres not a whole lot more to say about them  i eat them because im an old guy living alone and too often im just lazy  these do come in handy for a quick light meal  light depending on your appetite and the size of your tummybr br this is a good one to lead off with if youre just now getting into compleats  just note that in my opinion its middle of the road for the line  not a lot of flavor but goes down ok
1441,3,ive tried several of the compleats line including this one and they all have one thing in common the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on itbr br the chicken and rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce its very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor the texture of all of the ingredients is decent neither too firm nor too mushy except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy overall id say its fine in a pinch  these shelfstable meals are easier to find than most  but if you have other options available these are only fairtomiddlin
1442,4,these radiationtreated dinners that dont need freezing are a great convenience  ive tried quite a few of the hormel compleats and this is one of my favorites  home cookin it aint and its a bit too salty but for a satisfying meal in  seconds its hard to beat  the only reason ive given this flavorful decently chickenfilled dish  stars instead of  is because the rice is white  we all know by now that whole grains are healthier so until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice ill mark them down
1443,5,i subscribe to several hormel compleats this is definitely the best flavored dinner i have tried  i am planning to double my subscription
1444,3,like the majority of other meals in the hormel line this one is excessively salty that alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasnt swimming in sauce this ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins itbr br but its very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill its not my favorite of this type of meals but i wouldnt turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon
1445,1,me and my wife have tried a wide range of the hormel compleats and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch i could complain about the lack of chicken but the horrid taste evenbr overshadows that minor drawback i know its a cheap meal  but i do expect something at least a little edible  if you are looking to the compleats then go with something at least worth you money pick up the far superior tasting spaghetti or turkey dinners and feed this thing to the family dog
1446,4,not so sure about this product chicken and rice is not really what there is sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy all in all i still like it
1447,3,not bad but like others say a bit too salty i do notice a strange after taste tho i like boyardees better and wont buy this again
1448,2,this is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside  there is very little taste and very little chicken  it is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starchbr br it is not repulsively bad if you want a light convenient snackbr br the chef boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid which comes away easily  with these hormel compleats you have to pierce the top first and then peel it off afterwards which is not so easy especially as it is hot
1449,5,these dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains  quick easy and delicious
1450,5,im not so sure why the other guy didnt like this so much i love it  in fact it might just be one of my favorite foods around  its tried and true rarely cooks wrong and always good to warm the belly and soul  i only but this flavor its so good why deviate from it  i have tried other brands before bit maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time
1451,3,this is ramen a cheap easy and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap its got its pros and cons but mostly its pretty alright the chicken flavor is good some people find it too salty i like it as is the price here on amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale higher than others still if youre like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible maybe paying a  more for  isnt such a big deal nutritionally its pretty meh you could do a lot better but its also a versatile base you can always add lots of veggies meat other spices pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option we keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves
1452,5,im on a quest to try all the ramen flavors ramen is a good lunch for me being easy to make cheap and versital the chicken flavor is one i remember but i havent had it in a long time its one of the only flavors sold in stores where i live i made some recently its better than i remember salty but good this is one of the more americanized flavors i recommend not adding  cups of water i added a bit more than   cup and it was perfect     or   seems to be the perfect amount i like eating it as a soup so i dont pour out the water you can add things to ramen like meat eggs or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings whatever you like this is a great product i recommend if you want easy cheap lunches
1453,5,this is a classic ramen choice  our kids  love this  when were rving we have a case of this on hand  a bowl some water and  in the microwave and weve got our instant meal we break up the noodles while still sealed in the package  this helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them they dont seem to tire of these and were not overly offended by the nature of the justaddwaterproduct we each had our rameneatingcollegedays these also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch etc at work  just make sure you have a pack of paper not styrosave the enviro bowls and some forkspoons in that drawer too
1454,5,if you want a hot meal with no effort that is deliousthis is the way while cooking noodlesmicrowave left over meathot dogbolonisp also microwave a spoon or two of vegetableleft overfrozencanned after noodles cookadd season packetpour over meatvegafter a minute pour some of the liquid outyou have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out college kids live off this meal because it is cheapquick and can all be done in microwave if need be you can get a case of libbys carotpeas from amazon for about since you are using only a spoon or twolasts a long time
1455,4,a bit dry but still good they may be perfectly all right i just thought the noodles were hard and drybr im still enjoying them
1456,2,the taste isnt good at least isnt good for japanese and chinesebr its taste is basically sort of american japanese tastebr plus the price isnt competitivebr br id suggest asians never buy it
1457,4,i ordered this pack sampler and i have to say that i really do like the flavor of the donut shop classics pods  they are mellow smooth and have virtually no bitterness  i just cant believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods  i give them four stars because i prefer freshly roasted and ground but to date when im in a hurry in the mornings which is most mornings i reach for a pod of donut shop classics
1458,5,with this spice mix you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews  it is potent so do not use too much it smells heavenly perfect for both meat and bean stews
1459,4,if you like garlic this is for you ive been making this as a dip with greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise i usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips i have gotten rave reviews from my friends my only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out
1460,5,ive been eating the mcdougall right foods for a few years now and this is by far the best  it takes exactly the way the name suggests  it tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower and it is very easy to make  the only problem i have with it is that the noodles arent thick enough for me but i think one time i let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick  other than that id recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor
1461,5,span classtiny length  minsbr br spanskip the pad thai go for thisbr edit this soup has moved up to the  spot when i typed in dr mcdougall today im glad because i want to order this for a while and dont want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by right foods dr mcdougall
1462,5,i love the mcdougall asian entreacutees and although i havent tried all of them this one is amazing it has a really peanutty flavor that you wouldnt expect in a product containing only  grams of fat per serving i would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stirfry vegetablesi am buying a case now to test just that the peanut flavor is strong enough that i bet itd distribute among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you wouldnt get very saucy noodles and dry veggiesbr br i recommend this product the besttasting peanut noodle youll be able to find for only  grams of fat
1463,5,this is a very tasty item my wife doesnt eat meat and had to staybr in a hotel for  weeks during a training she attended i had this shippedbr to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more
1464,4,sure i could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product but i dont think i would have found a product as good and tasty as dr mcdougall the noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite i was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a thai food restaurant overall im pleased with my order and the quality of the product
1465,4,these are super tastey i would definitely recommend the only reason im not giving  stars is because i wish they were bigger d
1466,5,super tasty quick meal  its a bit small but perfect for a lunch on the go  definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs thoughbr br the sodium is a little higher than id like but i really cant beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood
1467,3,i like the concept and i like asian food but the roasted peanut noodle variety of this mcdougalls entree doesnt have enough peanut flavor for me  sauce is rather thin too and the flavors finejust not sure i could identify it as peanut  ill try a different variety next time i think
1468,3,tastes great price is okay received in timely manner but two of the soup packages were bent hope the price comes down
1469,5,there are many workdays when i only have a few minutes for lunch or all too often dinner on these days dr mcdougalls products are lifesavers i keep some fresh washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in  minutes just microwave this one for instance while cutting up some broccoli peppers a carrot and whatever else i have around i also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day cut in little twigs  delicous by the time youre through cutting youll have finished with cooking the soup and the soups standing time will be almost over it needs a few minutes to thicken up take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl toss the veggies in the liquid and microwave for about  minute  seconds when through dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious healthy meal the men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave  several are now also fans despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan when i am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in i add a spring onion on top i just use an office scissors to cut it if you can afford the calories a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition as well as is tamari yummy
1470,3,for a  calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely this really isnt bad its certainly better than chef bouyardee or easy mac or actual cup of noodles ive only ever had one other dr mcdougalls product which was the tortilla soup and i much preferred it i found this one to be a bit bland it was pretty much just dried cup of noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions i think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and i wasnt crazy about the texture of the noodles i guess i was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut saucebr br i only gave this three stars because i thought it was a bit of a let down i liked it but i didnt love it as much as i should have given my love of peanut sauce i would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but i certainly dont see myself buying them in bulk from amazon my goto desk drawer food is still annie chuns udon noodle soup bowl the calorie count is pretty similar i think annie chuns is like  or so but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed precooked noodles however if youre not in the mood for soup these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all
1471,3,first time ive tried this item its just ok the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me
1472,2,the noodles for this product are what make me gag  i am not a fan of this meal at all and i lt asian food  for those looking for a delicious snack who are not already  vegan  i would either a go try  first or b skip buying this package as it is not delicious
1473,1,i read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy decent tasting cup of noodles needless to say i found this not to be true first the consistency is gross and second the taste is awful maybe i am just not accustomed to eating crap think twice before ordering this product i wish i did
1474,5,these papers are great they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips even the glue tastes good
1475,5,these smell so good and are cute and a great size with a bend in the middle to help roll and holds together really well with tasty glue definitely recommend smell like strawberry bubble gum doesnt really affect flavor too much but better than plain ones and very sweet box says printed with soy ink so its clean and i dont have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics
1476,5,these rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper
1477,5,love this soup  i have been eating this soup for a long time i have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients and this one is the best by far  however i will not order it from amazon again  i ordered a case two different times and the first time  of the  cans were dented  the second order the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because  cans were busted open the other  cans were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans  it was a huge mess to clean up  they need to package items better  amazon did issue a full refund but after having  out of  shipments being damaged i am not willing to order soup or any other food items from them
1478,1,this coffee supposedly is premium it tastes wateryvery thin  not good at all  maybe oldbr not sure it was a waste and im using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rainedon luggage to absorb the smells  so i used it but not to drink  do not buy
1479,5,excellent very nice rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle mmmm  delish
1480,5,if you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use the real san marzano beware of imitators
1481,5,long ago i discovered that san marzano tomatoes were unparalleled for flavor when it comes to making sauces i tried many brands and have done many side by side tasting comparisons and cento san marzano tomatoes have consistently won out these tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor and a nice acid to sugar balance though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce its pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest due to their deep red color and soft texture many tomatoes advertise themselves as san marzanos but since sm is a type of tomato they could have been grown anywhere not these these are sm tomatoes grown in the san marzano region of italy in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes i have no affiliation with cento i just love a perfect tomato sauce use these tomatoes be sure to not cook the sauce for more than  minutes and youll see what i mean even using fresh locally grown inseason tomatoes i havent been able to get the depth of flavor that i do with the centos
1482,5,i wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so i ordered this and caputo  flour  these tomatoes are amazing  and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite italian pizza restaurant  the label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil  this stuff is jsut awesome  i ordered another  cans  shipping kills though
1483,3,my sister and i did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it and we couldnt tell the difference between these and the two other brands i had on hand i wouldnt buy them again
1484,5,as i was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion  after i was diagnosed with celiac i began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made  after  years i gave up trying  then i saw this mix in the store  years ago and got very excited with the prospects  when i make the cake i tweak the mix recipe a little i add to the dry mix  cup coco  cup chopped walnuts and  raisins i use  large eggs  cup apple sauce  cup of oil and  cup water instead of what is listed on the bag  this cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by namaste are our familys favorites  this includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are very picky eaters
1485,5,i served this wonderful cake at a christmas party at my house  as the only celiac in the crowd i decided to wait until the others had tried it before revealing that it was gluten free  everyone raved over the great taste  the package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake which is how i served it  my own two boys said it was the best cake i had ever made including the traditional wheat flour cakes i sometimes make for the rest of my family  it was moist spicy and rich  it reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when i was growing up and she was a terrific cook  i highly recommend this one
1486,5,this product arrived with the sanitary seal in place and in good condition  after nearly  months in iraq being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste  i really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great  you may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that though 
1487,5,not wanting to pay  per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans i came to my favorite online store amazon with free shipping i could not beat the price i went from paying  per pound to  per pound i was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious i bought them for my mother for mothers day because she did not get a chance to buy any for easter with  pounds i had plenty to share with my friends too
1488,5,these jelly beans are wonderful  they are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesnt take away the flavor  i would recommand these to anyone
1489,5,licorice jelly beans use to be my absolute favorite in the jelly bean flavors i no longer eat sugar  these were bought as a gift so i did get to try a few just to see how they  are  ive had many over the years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor  also their customer service is excellent i needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even one customer is happy  something lacking in most companies these daysbr to compare  i tried a couple jelly belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong  not enough of a licorice taste  gimbals is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean  this is a large quantity keep that in mind when purchasing  either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life or a large family or collection of friends to share with  unless of course your sweet tooth wont stop and then just savor them all yourself br enjoy
1490,1,i never got the product and complained about the non receipt  so i bought some in the store klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf
1491,5,soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added its a great nutritious highcalcium no cholesterol product at a great price buy a case
1492,2,makes nasty loose poo the dry food does the same thing ive tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools
1493,4,this product is very good  it goes a long way  but quite as good as the one at dd  good product not the less
1494,2,i have purchased locally many other flavors of da vinci syrups and ordered blueberry online to try it because it isnt available locally and i love blueberry well this was a disappointment to me very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor not to mention i paid x what i would pay locallybr very disappointed
1495,3,i am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies they are crunchy and flavorful and have nothing added  the tomato fragments are extremely dry and tough more like old sun dried and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes  i do appreciate that these are organic
1496,4,i absolutely love the just tomatoes tomatoe slices i thought the bits might be good for soups etc but they dont seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices i will ues these up but go back to the slices on the whole a great product
1497,5,i toss some of these in soups or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings they add a nice somewhat meaty flavor almost like bacon bits but healthy to almost any dish

1499,5,hands down the best formula on the market  sadly my breast milk dried up so i had to fine a formula  my poor son has so many gi stomach gas crying reflux etc issues  we were on alimentum for over a month  we even tried the ready to eat bc i heard it was corn free  i also tried the hypoallergenic version by enfamel  nothing made him betterbr br after researching dhaarai found some scary things  basically it is made by using chemicals  there are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this bc of the toxins  you can google it  anyway i found this organic formula that didnt have it in it you can buy dhaara seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals  i was nervousbc my son had so many issuesi didnt want to make it worse  but i tried it  seriously it has changed my sons life  he is a completely different baby  i no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymorei mean of course it is still therebut that is how much better it is  my son has been on this since he was  weeks  i know it says toddler but if you go to their site it is fda approved for infants  they say toddler bc they fully support breast feeding for the first year  it has the same cals fats nutrients vit minerals pretty much as the other leading brandsits just organicno dhaaraand they dont use corn syrup  seriously try this formula
1500,5,i cant believe i am the first to review this great productbr br we have been using a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbmjlcearths best organic infant formula with iron ounce canistera which is also a great product up until our little started showing signs of lactose intolerance after consulting with the pediatrician we started searching for a suitable alternativebr br whilst soy formulas are being offered as the lactose free alternative by many our first preference was nonsoy alternative we also wanted a natural  organic product free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients after a considerable amount of research and shopping around we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and naturalorganicbr br our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula
1501,5,you can find this pack for  dollars less at diaperscom  no reason they should be charging this much
1502,5,our  month old originally was spitting up a lot we had him st on similac regular then went to similac sensitive and finally to similac soy  the soy did the trick he was on similiac soy for the past  months when the similac recall went through my wife became disgusted with similac and suggested we try a new brand i was reluctant but did so anyway  we reminded ourselves that as babies get older they become less fussy less gassy and maybe they dont need soy anymore if thats what they were used to so i went to my local whole foods store and bought the lactose free babys only formula an instant hit  my son loves it  seriousely he gobbles it downall  oz in once shot before with the similac soy he would have to take a break in between  my wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy  well if adults like it i am sure babies would too   i am very happy thus far with our choice we were going to get natures best but read that the way they extract their dha is not ideal glad i realized that  so far so good  we always thought that our baby would be stuck with soy formulathanks to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition we realized that is not the case  i am happy about that since soy can cause some hormonal problemsbabies and adults alike  thank you babys only for making an excellent product 
1503,5,when my daughter was an infant she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis  for my son we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk  his stomach does react when i have accidentally had more dairy than i can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula especially given our asian background  i wanted something organic not soy lactose free and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria  my son didnt like it at first but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula  he has not been gassy nor spit up on it  i really wish amazon stocked it
1504,5,i love pasta but it does not love me  i just dont seem to be able to digest it  but this pasta not only tastes great it is so easy to digest  and as an added bonus it is healthy  low in calories  i have now tried every version of this pasta  they are all amazing  some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm but that is not the case  you simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta  then it is light as a feather because of how wonderful it tastes  because it is so light you would think that you were eating homemade pasta  almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box 
1505,5,i eat this pasta every day without guilt i love this pasta i maintain my desired weight without any problem you have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta but it is every bit as good
1506,5,each box is oz and usually i make oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and i and if we have leftovers its rare  this time however i had half of it leftover only bc we felt full and couldnt eat anymore  i wonder if this is bc of the high amt of fiber whatever this morning my hubby tells me hes down  lbs too  im jealous also ive been on an eating binge almost  weeks always feeling unsatiated last night i had no strong urges to eat snacks  i ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than bc i was truly hungry i wont say this is the outcome for everyone but i thought id share  im using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight id like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now too
1507,5,i love this stuff and only get it through amazon  it arrived on time and good condition and i enjoy it
1508,5,just a quick note a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product  we bought a box at whole foods and i was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content  amazingly its about  cheaper at amazon than at whole foods and being an amazon prime customer saved me on shippingbr ill be back for more soon  i love quality and a bargain
1509,5,love this pasta  i mix this with regular pasta for a meal half and half  love the lower calories and the fiber content
1510,5,my husband and i have been on a low carb diet for two years and i miss pasta most of all weve tried other low carb pastas and werent crazy about them but we loved fiber gourmet the taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta unlike other low carb pastas we didnt experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues if you know what i mean i cant wait to try other products from fiber gourmet
1511,5,love this pasta  does cook up a little firm cooked it a bit longer had it with pesto very good  my husband could not tell the difference so i know it is good  he is very fussy
1512,5,wow  this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the brands labeled as whole wheat pasta i tried them many times and simply could not get the same pastaeating experience  i eat half the box at a time which is about  ozs and its so filling i cant eat more if i wanted it keeps me satiated all night i dont even get the urge to snack this is like a miracle to me  even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the real and unhealthy alternative the other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it    minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says  im not sure if amazon will like this comment but it is much cheaper on the fiber gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day i am writing this review
1513,5,i am on a low carb diet and have lost  pounds  i was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until i came across this product on amazon  i cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy  definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save  my hubby and son love it too
1514,5,i dont know how they do it but this product is too good to be true  half the calories of regular pasta wow
1515,5,great product  recommended by dr oz  we love pasta but not the calories  this is much better than whole wheat
1516,5,i brought a box with me to visit my daughter and familybr we all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne  very much
1517,3,it is a good tasting productit does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still cant eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal
1518,5,first of all it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge  on auto delivery they are cheaper than the cheapest senseo pods that i have found targetwalmart  but check out the weight of coffee per senseo pod vs this particular baronet coffee pod  not all baronet pods are this weight however so check out the products carefully  i guess i had better mention that the coffee flavor is great  one order is for three boxes of these pods
1519,1,this coffee is absolutely horrendous  i cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees  i cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is  it doesnt even taste like coffee  the best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals  i am really bummed i cannot returned this  a complete waste of money  it all went in the garbage
1520,5,these pods are so much better than the senseo pods  at  grams these pods are packed with more coffee than the senseo pods making for a better stronger more flavorful cup of coffee  i use these in my melitta oneone  also love that each pod is individually packaged so they stay fresh  they come in a standup box dispenser which is nice too  i cant understand the other reviewer here who didnt like the coffee  i love this decaf  it really is the best pod ive found  also the value here cant be beat  comes  boxes in each order so in each order you get  pods  and baronet has so many flavors  do check on the other baronet flavors though because all the baronet pods are not  grams and all the pods dont come individually packaged  stick to the  gram individually packaged pods you wont be disappointed  i get three different baronet coffee pod flavors all on autodelivery  highly recommend  yum
1521,1,the flavor of these pods is horrid  i ordered them only because senseo was out of stock for so long and i needed some decaf pods and these had received a couple good reviews which i now suspect were written by baronet employees  i have never tasted such awful coffee before a big yuk for baronet
1522,4,i am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering  the strength of the coffee itself is very good  i can use one packet to make   oz cups with the senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money  plus it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning
1523,5,i had been using a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbubhyesenseo decaffeinated coffee count pods pack of a in my a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbxylaahamilton beach personal cup stay or go pod brewera although the senseo coffee is very good i wanted some variety this is what i found and its excellent the vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly leaves no after taste i drink tall cups  oz so what i am doing is using  of each type the vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great the senseo decaf is a little cheaper so i do that as a cost saving measure i also signed up for subscribe and save to further reduce cost  if you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer i am confident you will love this coffee
1524,5,so many different flavors to choose from  i ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful  it was the only decaf french vanilla i could find  i have decided to switch from my old brand to this one
1525,5,this by far the best pudding mix you dont see this on the store shelves everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding and i guess most dont like to cook pudding on the stove it is best when pudding is cooked cooked instant pudding does not equal this  carl
1526,5,weve been searching everywhere locally for this putting  i was so elated to find it on amazon  this is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues  thank you so much amazon
1527,1,how come you sent me instant chocfudge puddingbr the order told you to send me the cook  serve chocfudge puddingbr you show the picture of itbr why couldnt send it to mebr it makes me wonder if i should order anything else from youbr pissed
1528,5,my honey has a serious sweet tooth which i accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert martha whites muffin mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires onehalf cup of milk which i toss into my cuisinart and wahla six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time they are moist delicious and economic
1529,5,i followed the easy instructions and these turned out delicious i ate them all there were only  of them i mixed  cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron  cup muffin pan i cooked them in my small convection oven and they cooked up nicely they were moist on the inside the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into  the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh it is very easy to open also
1530,5,we love love love these muffins they are moist and delicious  we like them best the day you bake them the nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up then they are good as new our only complaint is that they are difficult to find  but def worth every penny 
1531,4,this was my first time purhcasing muffin mix as well as baking muffins  to me the muffins came out a little dry but tasted great and the people i shared them with said they were good too  i will more than likely purchase marth white muffin mix in the future  the muffin mix came at an excellent price and i cant complainbr thank you amazoncom for having most everything under the sun for sale
1532,1,i tried the martha white turtle fudge chocolate chip cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies i have ever made either there is someone on the staff of martha white who has a lopsided sense of humor or their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation i wasted my time a lot of money on chocolate and pecansand my effortmartha white either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies my husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage
1533,5,i brought  bottles  one i carry in my pocket and the other for home  i fell in love with this while on vacation in belize  just a couple drops does the trick  packs a ton of flavor but not too hot that it overpowers your food
1534,4,good product and decent shipping however the price was  and i later found the same item in a local store for  what a gouge
1535,3,not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal if youre looking for authentic thai this will give you only half the flavor so the name that it is only a taste of thai is quite accurate cartons are fancy but big for the amount they hold it is definitely enough for a meal but if youre looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat you had better grab two it is tasty enough for a meal but if you can get yourself to an authentic asian supermarket i guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price ie  boxes of noodles for   and im not talking about cup o noodles or things you find at american supermarkets but overall my husband and i being the noodlemongers that we are did enjoy these as something new for the palate however we will probably opt to order thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving
1536,3,its like eating a large box of paste  i enjoy the flavor but i usually cook them and then mix with something else im eating as its a nogo straight out of the box
1537,2,i simply dont like it it is easy to prepare but when i eat it i feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients i cannot even finish one fourth of it
1538,3,overall this was good but not great  the ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star  i think i was expecting a little more ginger taste  id buy it again especially if i can find a good way to punch it up just a little more  i may try that egg tip
1539,4,the taste of thai coconut ginger noodles are really yummy the coconut and ginger flavors are very mildbr br each recloseable chinesetakeoutshaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container one box makes enough for me to have  very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish the kids always lunge at the opportunity to have thesebr br the only negative thing i can say is that i wish there werent so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in  plus the noodles a single combined spice packet would be easier of course one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if youre not fond of it but i like them all
1540,2,we enjoy a taste of tais peanut noodles they rock  that peanutty flavormmm so we decided to try these um ginger not so much nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor and the ginger is a bit overpoweringbr br take this review in stride though if youre a ginger lover and im not talking gilligans island here then these may be right up your alley  just a bit outside for me though if i may mix my metaphors
1541,4,provided you use clean preferably purified water to cook this it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part gluten and meat free except for the shrimp flavorbr br while some people have remarked on the oversized packaging this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillagebr br while the coconut ginger variety tastes good it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual taste of thai id recommend the thai peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced thai flavor and highly recommend the a taste of thai peanut salad dressing added to salads meats or the peanut noodles for a very spicy thai experiencebr br overall for the taste and quantity the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal comparatively speaking in terms of price walmart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper compared to the subscription price but do not seem to carry the coconut ginger variety at least not at the store near mebr br if you havent tried this brand of instant noodles yet i think youll be in for a treat
1542,5,i really like this soup  it is mild and i dont like anything that is to hot  it is just right  has a good flavor and is something i can take to work and pop in the microwave i would buy it again and again
1543,5,this is quick easy and portable and i think it tastes great its my favorite flavor
1544,3,i bought these at walmart for less then  dollars a boxthere over   a box amazon for box of sixthen you need to add another  dollars to your order to get free shipping i would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned my box does say gluten free so maybe there are  versions
1545,3,a year or so ago i use to buy these quite often because they were glutenfree  last month i decided to order some again and this product no longer says glutenfree on the packaging and contains wheat  i didnt want them to go to waste so i ate one anyway  i became very sick  i do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat  just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheatgluten
1546,2,thanks for the egg tip it works very well and really helps this product  nevertheless i ended up giving away three of the six containers because i was not thrilled with the nutritional information
1547,4,its very tasty and very easy to make  if youre in need of a very quick filling meal and it needs to be gluten free this works out great  try the thai peanut one too
1548,5,we ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly my husband and i both like taking them to work for lunch heres my recipe so that i get more protein i slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before i leave home in the morning then i add the egg to the water before i cook it at lunchtime
1549,4,very tasty glutenfree option  my kids loved it as it wasnt too spicy
1550,4,the thai coconut ginger noodles are quick and easy to prepare you will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer
1551,5,i liked this so much that i reordered and will keepbr br reordering
1552,2,i had recently tried a similar product from trader joes and not having a tjs around me presently i decided to try this more readilyavailable variation  i didnt really like this thing too much  for starters there is too much packaging for my liking  too many things to throw away  and i agree with a previous reviewer that theyre kind of big cartons for how much they hold  inside the container are  packages  one for noodles and three for various seasonings  then you have to add water  they give you a fill line but its kind of awkward  then microwave for  minutes  then stir then microwave again for one minute  the one from trader joes only has two packets  one for noodles one for sauce  and no water involved  just microwave for  minutes and youre done  and those are a lot tastier  i didnt like the texture of this thing everything clumped together too much and it really didnt have much taste especially considering the three different packets of seasoning i put in  time to try a couple of the other brands of these things
1553,1,i bought these for my son to take to work for lunch apparently his coworkers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again maybe it was a bad batch
1554,3,i dont plan on reordering it but it was definitely edible and filling since i added chicken
1555,1,i tried these as i love thai food ginger and coconut that was my problem as this mess does not even vaguely resemble thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste plus the noodles stick together even when prepared as suggested and come out in a big clump when you try to eat thembr br also the nutrition label is misleading i am dieting and read labels very carefully this says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs oz half a cup i figured as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving that after adding water there would be one serving per package not so one package is actually two servings or over  calories this is far more than any other prepackaged noodle meal i have seenbr br the excessive calorie content might have been ok had the product tasted good but it doesnt i would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess
1556,5,this is a great and delicious way to eat thia food at home  just melt the entire packet if you like it spicy into two cans of coconut milk in a pan  then add your favorite meat and veggies  i usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies
1557,5,while the restaurants always do it best these curry pastes are pretty tasty its easy to use  fast and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice for those of you scared of something spicy you might use a little less but for most its just right and for those that like it spicier you can add a little crushed red pepper since the coconut milk has to be added separately you can also control the fat contentyou can go light or go with the much yummier creamy stuff i find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries and is maybe a little less spicy
1558,5,much hotter than your normal green curry one pack makes many servings
1559,4,used to use another brand that changed in a jar but this is so much better has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemonlime and a good amount of heat it is a little too salty though if you like to use a fair amount to spice it up we wish it had a lower sodium content while made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better this is the next best thing really good with chicken beef pork tofu and veggie dishes quick and easy to make goodforyou meals we dont like the packaging and wish it were in a jar but other than that and the sodium content we like it will buy again
1560,5,second order  very good hot which i like but best to sample as per your preferences
1561,5,i was really impressed with this  there are many flavors and quite a bit of heat  with this and your favorite brand of cocunut milk you can make some great thai curries at home
1562,5,different flavors for different people  not everyone is going to like this just as others like me will love this coffeebr br its totally subjectivebr br i give it  stars  i enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable in my opinion  it matches my local big box grocery store
1563,5,i was at a  star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting  it was fantastic  i asked the server if they could get me the name of the company but they were unable  thank goodness for amazon i was able to find it  its the best i have had in many years  it arrived on time and very securely packed
1564,5,i totally love this tea  it brews to a beautiful reddish color  it is very aromatic and beautiful to look at  it could be potpourri  i love the sachets it comes in  very elegant  i just bought my third canister of it this morning  i have everyone at my office and my friends loving it too  best with honey pearls also sold by white lion tea  and its organic
1565,5,this stuff rocks ive had it at two different spas and i just love it its tart and really unusual a real treat
1566,5,this is my husbands new favorite tea im not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good im sure well be buying more
1567,5,nice tea i can steep up too  times it has a strong cranberry flavor probably would be good as a cold tea i recommend if you love cranberry
1568,5,i found this tea  years ago while staying at a spa resort in washingtonbr br i absolutely love it its herbal and helps me to relax with its very flavorful taste and color great for colds as well as clearing the sinus soothing beautiful and deliciousbr br i have ordered this tea every year from amazoncom because the price is amazing and well worth it likewise ive given it to others as a gift when i can afford tobr br this tea is wonderful with honey sugar sweetener or just by itself a must purchase for every household also great for ontheroad for tea drinkers
1569,5,love it love it love it  both me and my  year old drink this herbal tea quite often  very tasty
1570,5,this is very good tea in an elegant sachet a little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether youre drinking it hot or cold
1571,1,found this product for sale on vacation in north carolina and loved it great maple flavor walmart sold it for  for the oz pack wish i would have bought some more while i was there because im not paying  for what walmart can sell for  that is just robbery very disappointed in zon for their insanely high price if price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher
1572,2,i had high hopes when i ordered this tea as years ago in san francisco i used to buy a lovely rose black in chinatown which was my favorite tea ever unfortunately this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine i prefer the opposite a fullbodied tea i can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof  but for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch this might be a good choice
1573,5,my doggie really likes newmans organic better than some other dog foods pet and bigbox stores sell my budget doesnt like newmans organic as much as harmony farms its the compromise that keeps the doggie and my budget happy  because he eats it heartily i dont worry that hes getting enough high quality food  otherwise he wont eat his food and hell graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the voidbr br theres no barfing digestion problems or accidents high quality food means good digestion a shiny coat high energy bright eyes and a good attitude without tons of additional elixers treats or vet bills a definite cost effective winwin for doggie and mebr br ive had great results with newmans dog food that i orderd through amazon but theres  pounds less for about the same pricebr br psst im not an organic fanatic its the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kidsbr br update  noticed this has jumped to almost thirty bucks will opt for newmans organic when the costs per pound are the samemy dog likes both harmony and newman my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase br br update  last batch of harmony farms i ordered had a rancid oil smell when i opened the bag and the pooch wouldnt eat it as readily as he has in the past he wouldnt eat for a day and started checking out the trash i subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods cooked brown rice etc as mixins to encourage him to make it through this pricey bag not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home but the texas heat can make anything stalerancidyucky quickly i probably should have called customer service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the hot weather here definitely exploring hot weather alternatives
1574,5,a few years back prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor i switched my dogs to foods without corn  i was convinced right or wrong that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections  i believe again right or wrong that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to cornwhich turned out to be the main ingredient in her food  sorry ill get off my soapbox and address the issue at handi found this food by accident  the only type the store had was the weight loss formula  turns out my dogs love it  i havent seen them so spunky and full of energy  ive got a coon hound and two jack russells mine are not the bounce off the wall kind mine are mellow laid back kinda dudes  they gobble this stuff up and seem to stay fullno more begging in the kitchen than normal everyones skin seems smoother eyes are brighter heck i think ill go have a bowl  all i can say is if you are looking for a good quality dog food this is the one for you  you will not be disappointed
1575,5,i have a  year old portuguese water dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach and a  year old shepherd x dog who was beginning to lose weight she slept almost all the time and she was getting very fussy about what shed eat i believe that with a dogs sense of smell they know exactly what is in their food however they have no choice but to eat what we feed themjust google what is in most commercial dog foods and youll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it upif a dog can detect cancer in a person they can detect all sorts of other things that arent supposed to be eaten anywayi used to feed purina lamb and rice to my dogs but i was finding my young porty was having trouble with it and my  yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish so i started making their food and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe the dogs loved my homemade dog food and my  yr old began putting on weight again but i didnt always have time to make their food and homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet so i started to research all the natural dog foods out there compare costs etc i arrived on harmony farms and guess whatmy dogs love it just as much as they love my home made dog food my young porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great my  yr old finishes her meals and looks for more both have shiny coats and energy no one can believe my old girl is  years old i have told my friends about harmony farms dog food and when theyve switched over theyve reported similar positive results my brotherinlaws dog had always been a very fussy eater and had skin problems with a thinning coat when they started to feed her harmony farms she became an eager eater more happy and outgoing and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up im thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food which i think was iams other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time nowand they had all been feeding their dogs premium top of the line dogs foods and paying top of the line prices harmony farms products are very reasonably priced not the cheapest dog food on the shelf but in my opinion you are buying the best quality food on the market so its an incredibly good deal it may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarians office i and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs 
1576,5,my coworker that does animal rescue brought in a whole dog journal recently and i was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods i had been feeding my dog beneful which is basically just junk food  i switched her off immediately hunted around on amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill shipping was free which was awesome and my dog loves the food i worried about that bc ive switched her before and shes been uninterested and ive had to top with gravy etcbr br do your research it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food its typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler  if you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what theyre ingesting should be high up on your list  im glad to have the knowledge now and i really wish id looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago
1577,5,no more heavy grocery bags for me  ive just ordered my first bag of harmony farms dog food  and it was delivered to my door by ups  the food is excellent quality  i bought this product based on its healthy ingredients the dogs love it and i love amazon for making it so easy to buybr br july   one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease  previously she had to have special food from my vet royal canaan duck  potato for the past years  she has tolerated even thrived on the harmony farms food wo any problems each bag of harmony farms is about  cheaper than the royal canaan  hard to fight  i am a believerbr br the canned food is great toobr br september   my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past verified by surgery has never felt better  she is a wire and has the energy of a  yr old dog she is  she is not on any daily medication  this healthy weight formula has helped her to thrive  enough protein not too much fat seem to do the trick i highly recommend it
1578,2,i was giving my shihtzu the fromm adult gold dog food she didnt seem to want to eat it though so i thought i would try something different i found the harmony farms and thought id give it a try she actually liked it its cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients i couldnt believe how she gobbled this up but after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach took her off and the rash went away completely in  days her hair also wasnt as soft this kibble did not do well for her
1579,5,i was using castor and pollux from amazon for my dog and i decided to try something different  my dog dug into this dog food right away  it has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother  and this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy levelbr br i catch my cat sneaking over to my dogs food bowl and eating this food too  i have to look into getting her some harmony farms  i can do this because harmony farms is really good quality food that is affordable
1580,5,i just ordered this came today and thought i would just try it well to my amazementmy little daisy ate it and wanted moremy little dog is just  yrs but has trouble with flareups with her pancreas i have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber i have been making her dog food but she missed eating the dryi wondered if it was small enough for her to chew  but it was
1581,5,had been feeding my  hounds purina one which they liked and thought id try this since its not much more and i liked the ingredients they love it and i plan to order more in the future
1582,5,everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands like purina iams or god forbid moist  meaty ingredients like ground flax seed peas whole carrots whole sweet potatoes apples blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners byproducts and lowquality corn show this to be truebr br i just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams proactive health and decided to make the results known i let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first and placed the two piles a bit apart he immediately went for the harmonic farms finished it and didnt even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for morebr br dogadvisorcom made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and i was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like i do to my great welcome surprise he didnt i guess hes a hippie at heart i on the other hand will take my nachos bell grande
1583,5,our ten year old doxieannie never thats right never would eat any dry food untilharmony farms healthy  holistic chicken  brown rice adult dog food that we bought from you every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food amazonyou are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this  pound bag of harmony farms dog food from youwell be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag  wow so happy about this
1584,5,harmony farms produces excellent dog food products  our  month softcoated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands  we were preparing to take him to the vet at about  months old bc he had great difficulty eliminating  to the point of whining as he would attempt to go  after more research on the breed we purchased harmony farms at a local store  it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppys digestive issues  after  days on only harmony farms products our puppy was happy and healthybr br i was so happy to find harmony farms on amazon  it is more economical and delivered right to our door  our puppy connor eats only harmony farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now definitely recommend it for softcoated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands
1585,5,wish i would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes my  year old jack russell has always had the worst shedding problem and i recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition was feeding her purina dog chow shes only been on this dog food for two weeks and i can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding she loves the taste and i love the price for such a good quality dog food
1586,5,when i purchased the harmony farms healthy weight formula i had a mini dachshund and jack russel terrier  both of them love it  i have added a shih tzu to my pack and she loves it also  i would highly recommend it to others  the kibble is just the right size for small dogs
1587,5,the main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands  my dogs coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago  the other nice thing is that target sells this brand so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you havent ordered more in time you can stop by target
1588,5,i am very pleased with this dog food my sheltie has a good coat and good movements with harmony farms does much better with this food than others he is a very picky eater so i do add chicken and he will eat we will stick with harmony farms i also like the bag it helps keep the food fresh
1589,5,my dog loves this food and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years  the vet is very happy with her general health coat and teeth  having the lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific  the  lb size is not available in my area
1590,5,while on a family camping trip with josh our yr old golden we ran out of dog food stopped at a wegmans market in erie pa to shop for a quality food settled on the harmony farms chicken josh liked it right awaybr weve been mixing it with his normal food canidaebr hes very healthy and playful his coat is shiny hes a happy pup
1591,5,my dog loves loves  this dog foodi had to say love twice because this dog food is one of his dogs favorite
1592,5,i have purchased this product once before from amazon  it was delivered promptly and in tact  this is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at petsmart in new york but in arizona it is no where to be found  this food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all  we try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it  so now we go through amazon and our dog is quite happy  bought a double amount to receive free shipping  it was a very good deal
1593,5,i have a nearly  year old golden retrieverstandard poodle mix and a  year old german shepherd the doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice just switched her a few weeks ago from nutro max and the shepherd gets the healthy weight i have tried several different foods for the doodle and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky stinky farts with this while switching from the nutro max she had none of those problems in fact i only took  days to switch her instead of  or so weeks and she didnt have any digestive problems both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective several dollars cheaper at my local wegmans and there are always coupons in the paper this is a very high quality food for the price and i like that its available at the grocery store as i live in a small town i highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live
1594,5,my dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through amazon i am able to save money per pound and trips to the store it arrives promptly and is the same quality as always harmony farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods love it
1595,4,i purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients no doubt about the quality of the food and my  month old dachuhund puppy loves it but i realized this doesnt have dha that helps to develop cognitive brain function also the kibble might be little big for a puppy so i believe its a great food for an adult dog but i wouldnt recommend it for a puppy
1596,5,this dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues  as they have had with other brands  they both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food i have been very pleased with the automated delivery service
1597,5,since i live in a rural area sometimes id drive to town just for dog foodneedless to say that was expensive  for  wfreeshipping the harmony farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality namebrands  my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry  flaky i love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy  very thankful its something i can afford as well  only wish amazon offered a subscription service for this item like they do on others
1598,5,i am always pleased with the variety of shopping items that i find on amazoncombr i have never been disatified with my purchases through amazoncombr when searchomg for things even dog food i automatically go to amazoncombr before any other site rarely do i chose another site  amazoncombr really rocks  thanks for being therebr jmeadows syracuse ny
1599,5,i just switched my  and a half year old boxer to this food and it is awesome she switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food it has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach it also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in i wish i had found this food  years ago it is great and we will switch our boxer puppy to it when it is time alsovery affordable
1600,5,in my opinion this is the best food for dogs  my boyfriend is an avid researcher and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts  taste the dogs love it healthwise it has healthy fats and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn and digestionwise the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food  we have two dogs we adopted from a shelter and while at first one of our dogs would not eat the food he had worms though so who knows what junk he was eating before he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon he came to love it  now they jump when its dinner time  our dogs are happy very healthy have shiny coats and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food  we get it on subscribe and save and we usually go through  bag p month  for reference we have one lb bichon and one alaskan husky
1601,5,i have  huskyshepherd mixes the first is  months and has a finicky stomach  if he eats too fast drinks too fast or eats anything out of his routine he would bring it back up he also wouldnt eat more than a few nibbles at a time the nd is  months old and came to us with severe diarrhea vets food didnt fix it either he would eat anything and everything if we let him within a day of both dogs being on harmony farms no fasting just a quick switch both dogs digestive issues are gone my oldest the finicky eater is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation my youngest has solid regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result theyre both more relaxedbr we purchase at our local grocery store hannaford here in ny for about lb for the price ingredients and results  you cant beat it
1602,1,i read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pupbr they will not touch it even if i mix it with home cooked foodbr br they like the dollar store dog food better than thisbr br amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name
1603,5,these chips are wonderful  my kids and i all loved the salt and pepperbr each  oz bag was  calories lots of chips for the calorie count
1604,5,great packaging and item is just as described will purchase this item again they were shipped very fast and efficient
1605,5,just to give a little background  i ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and i thought i would give them a try  the variety of flavors in this package was great and i enjoy most of them  these chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag  it is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip  it will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture but i would highly recommend trying these out
1606,5,got this item on a onedayonly sale on amazon  love having the singleserving portion as i am following ww plan  only  points plus per serving  tasty and on the same line as the special k crackers  the variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile  cheddar and bbq are my favorites  try them
1607,5,i discovered pop chips awhile back and fell in love with the bbq flavor whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative hubby is a teacher so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at schoolbr br since i mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week i thought the variety pack would be different for him he gets his crunchy fun and doesnt realize the pop chips arent as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting score plain are fine vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich
1608,4,i really liked these chips as did my entire family i wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack i would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind
1609,3,these popchips were something i wanted to try because they were baked the barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible
1610,4,i like these pop chips a lot but not all the flavors  this variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like  these chips have strong flavor and are not greasy  they are fairly filling and make a great snack  theyre pretty noisy like most chips so dont take em to the local theaterbr br these came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging  i can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as i found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things and after several months it still tasted fine  br br these are a pretty good size for a quick snack  quality has been consistent over several different batches  i really like the texture and crunch and love the lack of greasiness
1611,5,these tastes good if its not fried not bad for you and tastes good then why not eat them of course not a lot at once but these are great healthier snacks
1612,2,i bought two bags of popchips at whole foods original and barbequeand loved them  when i went to amazon to order lots more i liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones which id consume too quickly  i knew i was taking a risk but when the order came i really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment  in addition only the original and barbeque nutritional values calculated at  pts the others were all   i still like popchips but will only buy bags of the flavors i know i will enjoy eating and not have to choke down  i recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order
1613,5,i had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local target in oz bags  i am so glad that i bought this variety pack not only did i discover other flavors that i enjoy but its single serving size so its better for portion control  i love popchips and i find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips
1614,5,i like these chips a lot now i have a whole  pack  this is how i get my chips on while i fish
1615,5,a while ago i got a bag of the bbq at a store to go with my lunch and i loved these so when i was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save i knew that this was something that i had to have for my lunches i love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet i have not found a flavor i did not like being from england i am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as i would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors i cant complain i also love the fact that  fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack my only issue now is that i have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as i do i have now had to go to a box a month but even then i am not sure i can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can
1616,4,good flavorful chips  too bad the selection does not include jalapentildeo or paramsan garlic packaging is difficult to open but they fresh
1617,5,these are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips  great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty crunchy snack  they are light and crunchy and they taste really good i was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good  the original flavor reminds me a lot of the munchos chips  the original flavor and saltvinegar are my favorite but they are all good  my least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor i dont like cheddar but most people really like it i have purchased these several times now and i will continue to do so  i  highly recommend this product for anyone
1618,4,for all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy these chips are a great alternative  no they are not like fried but the flavor along with the caloriefat benefits make this a great choice i liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors i would like as it turns out i like them all but i do have my favorites like bbq salt  vinegar and plain so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus  i have already placed two orders since my initial purchase
1619,5,i got these for my gf as she isnt supposed to eat any gluten  all of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips  if you are looking for a glutenfree snack i highly recommend popchips
1620,4,i like all the varieties except the salt and pepper  they taste too much like black pepper and nothing else  the others are very goodla hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbrvfdoopopchips flavor variety pack ounce single serve bags pack of a
1621,5,the products are wonderful and fresh  everything reported about the chips is on target and i would recommend them to others  amazons services are fantastic
1622,5,i really enjoy these low calorie chips  they have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crispbr br i was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole  flavors  say just  flavors if desiredbr br its a great product dont stop manufacturing them
1623,5,these are really good tasting chips they arent too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount love the flavoring
1624,5,i have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have i found a great choice in popchips  these are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips  i love special k cracker chips but they only come in big bags  i saw these and they are packaged the way i like individual serving bags so i gave them a try  now i will never be without them  they are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag  finally a goodtasting healthier potato chip that i can enjoy
1625,5,i wasnt sure about these chips but thought i would give them a try these are tasty crispy chips  and only  calories a bag i like all the flavors included in the variety pack i definitely will buy again
1626,5,these chips are very tasty  its a nice size serving and only  calories  good grab and go snack for busy moms
1627,3,i agree with many of these reviews  the product tastes good  not fantastic but good  i dont like real greasy potato chips and prefer baked lays  however if you do enjoy real greasy potato chips please see the review referencing pringles and steven baldwin  very funnybr do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but dont want to devour a large bag of fatfilled chips  dont buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips  eat a banana or apple instead and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugarbr if you do get the big box  just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them  and if you do bonus you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two
1628,4,the popchips were great and they were fresh when they arrived for the price i wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks
1629,5,aboulutely love popchipsi first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in california i like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had
1630,5,this product was everything and more according to the advertisement  i was totally satisfied with my purchase  i recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site
1631,5,popchips is a new product for meordered after seeing an ad in weight watchers magazine  loved the product  packing was perfect  shipping went fine  no complaints with this order at all  probably will order again soon
1632,5,i have to watch my calories but i tend to not be very successful if the food i eat is tasteless  i have enjoyed all six flavors of these popchips and feel great eating them at  calories per bag  my favorites are sour cream  onion and the sea salt and vinegar flavors  in fact theyre so good i just want to keep eating them and have to resist opening a second bag because that really defeats the purpose  i like the variety pack and its not a bad value
1633,4,the product is exactly what it is portrayed to be tasty not yummy but good i received the product promptly i ordered  cases and will eat every package
1634,5,i love these chips they taste so good i am on a low cal diet and they are perfect the individual bags keep you honest thank you popchips
1635,5,these are delicious  my husband and i just love them  especially the bbq and salt and vinegar flavors  i like the individual packages  its a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping
1636,4,im a crunchaholic i have to have something during the day to crunch all other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on popchips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too i highly recommend them all but the salt and pepper are my least favorite
1637,5,these are the best snacks for me as i am a lap band patient  they fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size
1638,3,yum i had tried the original and the barbq and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack for whatever reason the  pack is cheaper then the  the flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to msg and gave my grandmother a bad headache so if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to msg do not give them these  these are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling you are better off eating a granola bar
1639,5,a dream for those on weight watchers who love potato chips the individual serving bags of pop chips are only  points and taste delicious
1640,5,these are a great size and healthy  they satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise
1641,5,these chips are great substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered  i keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture
1642,2,i bought these and tried each flavor i could not even finish any bag but the barbecue i really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross and the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me how is this the  bestselling item amazed anywho to each his own godbless and enjoy but if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind
1643,5,i cant believe these are actually decent for you  they taste awesome  i love these chips they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor  i am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend who hates anything thats healthy  i recommend these to all my friends  im on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all
1644,5,i am on weight watchers and these chips are only  points and they taste great  i like every kind  i use the plain chips to dip with my salsa  i would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not
1645,5,this is a great product i was a chipaholic and knew i needed to cut back on them then i was introduced to popchipsi have found my alternative these chips are great low in fats but high in flavor i purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere i am sure these will catch on and become a big hit
1646,5,saw these in whole foods and thought they looked interesting didnt care for them instantly but by the time the first bag as gone i have a husband and kids i was hooked wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it personally i like the plain and also the saltpepper my kids love all of them though and while these arent fruitveggies i feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips
1647,5,we received our assorted single serve packs today this is the first time we ordered popchips they taste so good we are already down by  packets between adults and kidsbr please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with regular fried potato chips the low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve  stars im sure we will be ordering more yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative
1648,5,i wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because i never ordered snacks of the internet  so after finally decided to order it it arrived within  days the flavor is awesome just like what i hoped for if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you if you are happy with the regular potato chips and doesnt care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are those chips have so much flavor they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor i have lived in the uk for a while and one thing i have always missed is the crisps that i used to eat in uk those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps i will be order those again
1649,5,i am a huge fan of pop chips they had them at my grocery store but their supply was dwindling so i was afraid they werent planning to order more i purchased two cases  individual bags of pop chips they are all excellent purchasing them in the variety pack gave me access to flavors they didnt have at the grocery store salt and vinegar cheddar salt and pepper ive enjoyed all the flavors barbecue is still my favorite though i also got a better deal buying them online
1650,5,i have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list  that being said pop chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with  different flavorsbr br my favorite flavors are salt  vinegar by farbr br the calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair
1651,3,definitely better than pirate booty and slightly better than baked chips very tasty but you feel as if youre almost eat something with the same texture as cereal its a small payoff to enjoy chips albeit faux chips the vinegar and sp ones are nasty
1652,4,i bought the flavor variety pack  they are pretty good nice thing is that im not  sure if im crazy about the texture so by the end of an  oz bag i dont really want anymore  however in my quest for different snack foods i found the food should taste good line of cracker chips  my money will be spent on those rather than pop chips  however i think that people should give these a try as well
1653,5,the bbq chips are great  we liked them better than regular chips  they have a nice crunch  hate kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glassbr br we will definitely be buying more of the popchips
1654,5,these really are good i gave some to other people and they liked them too the plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa when eating the bbq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when i would eat bbq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range i think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at  cal per pack
1655,5,to those of you and theres a lot of us who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intakethese chips are a in my bookbr br first of all the flavors are incredible very tastey and enjoyable  the single serve bags are just the right amount and a very nice portion might i add and the calorie intake is only  calories for the entire single serve bagbr br im so happy i tried them i bought the variety pack of single serves and i cant say enough good things about thembr br theyre crispy and crunchy and the flavors arent to salty just rightbr br so to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack you cant go wrong with popchips  im hooked now i just have to make sure i limit myself to only    bags a daybr br they really are good and the nutritional information isnt bad at allbr br so woo hoo for those of us who cant sit down with a big old bag of herrs or utz and just cant seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again dont get me wrong im not bashing on herrs or utz i love them both however theyre much higher in calorie than the popchipsbr br do yourselves a favor and give them a try you truely cant go wrong even my friendsfamily who dont have to watch their calorie intake enjoy them as well so thats saying somethingbr br hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackersbr br keep on munching the healthy way with popchips snacks
1656,5,found these while looking for good cheap lowcalorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office  after my first shipment i decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe  save  my next shipment arrives in two days im so excitedbr br gotta have my pop chips
1657,5,my husband and i both really like the popchips  they are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying
1658,5,i read a reference to these on jillian michaelss website checked out the popchips web page and liked everything i read but the proof is in the tasting of course they arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that popchips are incredible they taste sinfully good crunchy and just yummy i love sea salt and vinegar chips in general and truly loved the popchips version anyone on weight watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only  measly points highly recommend it
1659,5,what a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track  these are very tasty and crunchy  great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves
1660,5,my whole family loves these chips  i am following the weight watchers plan and the whole bag is only  points there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it
1661,5,i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks my friend told  me about pop chips that she bought from amazon she said she loved them and i should give them a try i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack
1662,5,the only complaint i have with pop chips is that i cant get all of the flavors at the stores where i live my husband and i both love pop chips his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion  pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake we cannot say enough good things about them
1663,5,i love popchips  they have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste  they are very similar to munchosvery light and fluffy  if you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories
1664,4,the original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their ownbr the salt and pepper flavor is awesome  really tasty and a great snack for only  caloriesbr the sour cream and onion is a little chemically but decentbr the barbeque is good but not tasty enough  the flavor doesnt go as well with the texturebr br havent yet tried the other two flavors  will update as i dobr br if you havent tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes  less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fatbr br so far i have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active  these definitely beat a    calorie bag of potato chips as a snack
1665,5,i bought these when they were on a gold box dealthinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunchesand then id never buy them againbr br not sobr br theyre actually really tasty  exceptionally crunchy  and the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips  definitely going on subscribe and save for a whilebr br i dont think theyre any more salty than standard potato chipsbut theyre by no means low salt
1666,5,popchips are a great guiltfree way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar they are clean light deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavorsthey would make a great lunch box addition popchips will be on hand in our home from now on
1667,5,i received my box of assorted popchips a few days ago to support my weight watcher meal plan  i absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan  without hesitation i recommend all varieties of these chips  what a great idea
1668,2,very tasty chips original and other flavors but ones with salt flavor way too saltynot sure who likes so much salt in chips
1669,5,what a great snack  i love these crispy crunchy treats  packaged in a single serve bag i buy these by the pack of  assorted flavors so i have them on hand whenever i feel the urge to snackbr unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than i had anticipated  time to order some more  all the different flavors are seasoned just rightnot too salty or spicy  i love popchips
1670,5,these chips are awesome the light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack i am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice gives me that salty crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day i love them i have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them i havent tried all the flavors yet only those in the variety pack but trust me i will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite that may be difficult they are all so good
1671,4,i tried these in colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast amazon didnt sell the ones i wanted i put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one within a week of their birthday amazon emailed me that it was available great chips but took longer to ship then expected just in the nick of time for the birthday when you want something real bad amazon usually comes through
1672,5,we absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from amazon we were able to find them in target  they have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we werent trying to loose weight  recommended by weight watchers
1673,5,popchips are absolutely delicious and getting the variety pack is great  everyone in my family has a favorite flavor  highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving but are not nearly as bad for you as chips
1674,4,i really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat  i especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar  i dont care for the salt and pepper  i wish i could get a multipack and choose the flavors i want
1675,5,we have played this with three adults  fun game that does not take too long to play  makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans
1676,5,thats all i can say yum at a great price i cant find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome
1677,5,great low cal snack satisfies the crunchy snacky salty cravings without high calories  all flavors are good  the cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste
1678,5,i have a free sampling of these chips and i can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings they remind me of munchos but are less greasy try them
1679,5,if you havent discovered pop chips yet  you dont know what you are missing  low calorie and high in flavor  great for the kids lunches i need the single servings or i will eat the whole big bag
1680,5,i am so happy to try and enjoy popchips they were recommended on calorie countcom products like this are not available at local grocers caloriecountcom mentioned the snacks were available from amazoncom which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door the pop chips are delicious they come in many flavors i have ordered them twice and shared them with friends we love the single serving  calorie packs the treats are tasty and delicious i am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available thanks amazon i am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation the variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other  calorie treats this product gets a  rating from our family
1681,5,these have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt and or sugar  they have texture and flavor and a bag hits the spot  i would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines
1682,5,i love popchips  these are the best  individual serving bags flavors are great taste is excellent  my daughter and grandson love the barbeque  i have found that buying them through amazon is cheaper and amazon offers the bigger bags also  i have to watch that because i could eat the whole bag
1683,5,i am a chip fanatic when i heard of these i had to give them a try they are very tasteful esp the bbq ones  i have yet to try the other flavors but i am sure they will not disappoint  i watch my weighthealth so these are perfect just becareful because they are addicting
1684,4,good variety of the flavors makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack
1685,5,this is a great snack to have instead of potato chips lower in calories but still delicious will be ordering them again
1686,5,i was very pleased with the popchips  my first order was before the chips hit the stores  the taste is delightful  no greasy taste in fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited  amazing how it is made  calorie count is great too i went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them  my third order i placed for a gathering of  friends  they too could not get over the variety of flavors and how they were made i feel the product itself won over more prospective customers try it yourself i know you will be very pleasedbr br trish kowalski
1687,5,i love popchips they are delicious and i cant believe one bag is only  calories the flavors are great although i am not a fan of salt and pepper i would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors i am sure you will love them too
1688,5,i hate healthy anythingbr br but i am overweight so i need an alternative to my normal routine of doritos potato chips the only reason i tried these chips is because of the other reviews so i am contributing my  stars toward the productbr br from just looking at it i was expecting it to taste more like rice cake but i was pleasantly surprise the chips tastes great very crisp i dont really know how to explain itbr br all the flavors are great my favorite is the bbq the original is a bit too salty but still very tastybr br highly recommended at least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack
1689,5,im trying to eat healthier and one of the things i really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds  these popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving though i dont really care for the pepper flavor i like all of the others  i will buy these again
1690,4,i found these chips on vacation in oregon  the store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store  i had never seen them before  they are different than regular chipsno oily taste but very flavorful  i didnt know if i could get them in ca so i ordered a case
1691,5,these taste great and are a healthier alternative my favorite was the sea salt and vinegar i probably wont order the other flavors again since i have a favorite and dont eat potato chips all that often but the variety pack was great to get to try them all
1692,5,these are great  my entire family loves them  it is a great addition to my sons school lunch  and i have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal chip out on the market  great flavor  bbq and sourcream  onion are our favorites  love the single serve bags  wish you could buy them at the store  but for now i will continue to purchase on amazon  because of the great service and varieties
1693,5,these chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried i love love the bbq flavor  i also like how the chips dont crumble in the bag
1694,4,these are great little snack packs  flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal
1695,4,i tried this chips in a hotel that i stayed at and loved them i ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them im on my second order
1696,5,popchips are very good  the varity received lets you try the diferent flavors  i only wish i could find them locally
1697,5,these are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake  you get a lot of chips for minimal calories and they taste great
1698,5,great selection of chips  very fresh if you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips  dont like the fake taste of baked these are just the most amazing chips you can eat i bought  cases  every time im at target or our super box store i make sure to pick them up
1699,5,i agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options  the texture of the chips is great and theyre very flavorful  i can certainly taste the sodium but if this isnt a problem for you i would recommend trying them  its a snack i look forward to having a chance to enjoy  everyone has their favorite flavor im no exception bbq ftw so i recommend trying the variety pack first  i thought id have at least one or two flavors wed hate but nobr br my initial purchase of an alternative snack was stacys pita chips in parmesan garlic  herb  nothing against them but they lacked the flavor punch i was looking for  these popchips are exactly rightbr br i can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty flavorful snack
1700,5,i loved these chips they were exactly what i had been looking for they are not friedgreasy or bakeddry they were greattasting satisfying and healthy alternative to regular potato chips you can feel good about eating these chips cant say enough youll have to try them for yourself i am ordering more now
1701,4,although i can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips they are a good alternative and very tasty the flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store it is the texture that is different they are less oil a good thing and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper all of the flavors are good except for the cheese one i didnt care for it although my twoyearold likes itbr br allinall for the calories you cant beat it and for long term weight maintenance and health these are great and delicious as well amazoncom sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store
1702,5,the chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and weight watcher point value
1703,5,i was on the fence about buying these for months i read the reviews and were impressed by them but the possibility of being stuck with  bags of chips i hated made me nervous this was my first food order from amazon and i am glad i picked this product to be i absolutely love these chips i deiced on the variety pack to start with in case i didnt like one flavor had others i could eat turns out though i enjoy them allbr br they are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture one bag fills me up as a midday snack the flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip for me this was a good thing i would have to say the bbq is my favorite the flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end my bags had very few broken chips in them everything about this order was greatbr br my father was around when i was trying my first bag making fun of them cause they were healthy i offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect he looked at me confused once he ate it promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it this is a man who hates anything healthy but shows how good the flavors arebr br i will definitely be buying these again
1704,5,i picked up a  oz bag of the salt and vinegar chips last weekend at wegmans and in a blink of an eye the bag was gone  very nice vinegar flavor  bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control  i ordered the variety pack in  oz size single serving to help with portion control  most of the flavors i like  but fair warning the parmesan garlic is very garlic love the salt and pepper  with  calories a pack what a nice change from baked chips  try it  you will like it
1705,5,popchips are really really good dont expect a regular old greasy potato chip but do expect something equally awesome that stands on its own popchips dont leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other diet chips and they dont have a lot of fat and calories  only  cal per singleserve bag i got the variety pack and liked every one of the six flavors  some better than others because im not a big fan of cheddar chips by any maker so these were as good as any but all were good most were great even nondieters who tried them liked them it seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips but maybe thats because i had to buy a case even so theyre worth it if youre fighting the battle of the bulge and want a local indulgence you wouldnt otherwise be able to enjoy my recommendation eat popchips
1706,5,heres the straight talk from a foodie not a top chef food critic but a foodiebr name pop chips they are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat fantastic not baked or fried made by the company pop chips so it isnt frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed america in disguisebr packaging and branding colorful and way too heavyduty bags this is why they are slightly expensive similar to kettle chips packaging you will have fun opening the bags with a pop packaging was great ive eaten about  of the small bags and not one was even slightly damagedbr taste and texture they are about the size of halfdollar coins kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the marketbr nutrition  calories unfortunately you know what this means its not a big grab by any means its about  chips per  oz bag which honestly is great for portion control its probably all we need and popchips knows it definitely more filling than other  calorie snacks made by say snackwell or the oreosmini muffins typebr flavor the  pack comes with cheddar potato sea salt and vinegar and barbecue potato as an english major im inclined to take the potato off the label just as salty and flavorful as normal chips but not overpowering like some cheap tortilla chipssome doritos natural tastebr i bought these on sale with a  discount i believe i might purchase them again if i won a gift card or something but i would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cashtrees on the gigantic box they come in but if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed you wont be this is definitely quality over quantity
1707,5,i ordered these chips due to other readers reviews being so good in addition my pregnant wife and i enjoy foods that are portioned and easy for taking on the go but the main reason i ordered these chips was that they are a health conscious choice and the flavor does not disappoint they are excellentbr br here is a nutritional breakdownbr br calories br calories from fat br total fat gbr saturated fat trans fat poly and mono gbr cholesterol mgbr sodium mg  br potassium mg  br total carbohydrates g  br dietary fiber g  br sugars g  br protein gbr calcium br iron 
1708,2,i hate to type this because there are so many people that really enjoy this product but take a look at the ingredients in this socalled allnatural product i have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me so that is the only flavor i can vouch for right now  about halfway down the list of ingredients youll see yeast extract unfortunately this is the new msg  many people are still unaware of this fact and natural food companies are taking advantage  it is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary  google msg yeast extract for yourself or check out

1710,2,these are to potato chips as pringles are to chips as instant coffee is to brewed coffee and stephen baldwin is to alec baldwin  same family but scant resemblance  so id buy a single small package at your grocers and try them out  not for everyone and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys  even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate  crispness is ok  even mouth feel is good but there is a lingering not good taste  again kind of like pringles  ps the flavors are ok but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the jersey turnpike
1711,1,purchased the oz bag seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased but didnt realize it was  ounces as compared to other bags  just be aware  might be perfect for some but not for us  having a bag with  potato chips in it doesnt cut it for me  might be perfect for kids  but just a heads up
1712,5,we tried these chips because dr oz had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative  my whole family loves them we have not found a flavor that we dont like  these are way better than any baked style chip  try them and you wont be disappointed
1713,5,these chips are pretty delicious even the original flavor with nothing on it is good its not as delicious as doritos but its also not fried either which definitely balances it out a good snack for all times of day
1714,5,my kids loved these and they were such a great deal i didnt feel so guilty about giving my kids chips
1715,4,like many others we were on the fence about buying these popchips with the possibility of being stuck with  bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat  turns out though we enjoy them all the kids like the plain ones saying they taste like pringles and my wife and i are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt  we are not fans of bbq chips in general but still ate the bbq popchipsbr br i will definitely be buying these again
1716,5,everyone should try these chips they are healthier than regular chips and they taste good
1717,5,this was our first time trying popchips but i had heard so many good things about them so i was eager to try them  we ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors  my kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar  my favorite by far is the bbq flavor  we love popchips here
1718,5,these are the best alternative chips i have ever tried i have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree you get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer they are great only  points for each bag
1719,4,possibly the best salt and vinegar chips healthy or not ever  the salt is just right and compliment the vinegars tartness perfectlybr br all the chips are good salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming
1720,5,these are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market its not greasy doesnt leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market  first time time tasting it was during the natural product expo west  in anaheim fell in love with it almost right awaybr br the only thing i can complain about this product was probably the price which is higher compared to chips of other brands  in addition the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety packbr br amazons pricce on this item along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost instantaneously  if you have a costco nearby you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price slightly higher than what amazon offers though
1721,5,this variety pack is perfect for when you want something crunchy and saltybr the selection of flavors were great choices for me  i liked them allbr the portion keeps you from overeating and they are healthier for you thanbr potato chips even the baked onesbr i recommend these and will be buying them again and again
1722,5,the popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips they are not greasy and only  calories per bag great for dieters fits in with a low calorie diet definitely would recommend trying at least once
1723,5,totally amazing and very deliciousbr br my favorite flavors from best to worstbr br  barbecuebr  sour cream and onionbr  cheddarbr br  salt and pepperbr  originalbr   vinegar and sea salt
1724,5,salt and vinegar and bbq rock  plain were okdidnt really care for cheddar  nice to start wa variety pack to find the ones you prefer
1725,4,if you had to choose my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar followed by salt and pepper suprisingly the original flavor was my least favorite probably because i was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer very tasty chips healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor in fact the taste is better than most regular chips ive had would highly recommend this product this is a really nice product
1726,5,i got these for  for the  pack so a pretty good deal they are about as healthy as the baked chips i usually buy  they all taste great and im officially a fanbr br its pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked  so they do have some air in them   ounce bags is slightly more than the  ounches in baked lays bags i was buyingbr br good buy if you can get a good deal like i did
1727,5,popchips are a healthy and light alternative to regular potato chips  they are full of flavor and only  weight watcher points per delicious bag  i have shared these chips with family and friends and they are all now fansa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbrvfdoopopchips flavor variety pack ounce single serve bags pack of a

1729,5,excellent taste for a low calorie snack  this size bag is exactly  calories and you get a lot of chips  i prefer these to the regular greasy chips
1730,5,i expectedidkmaybe tasteless cardboardbut these are really goodi have only tried the bbq so farbut it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag  i will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the  pack with us for some moderately healthy snackingmy only caveat isthese could prove to be addictivei am looking to watch my weightand these are definitely a temptation  very happy with this product
1731,3,i order these chips on a regular basis  if you are doing weight watchers these chips are  points a bag  when this particular shipment arrived at my house it was poorly packaged  i received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips  this is the st time in the four times that ive ordered these hopefully it wont happen again
1732,5,i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience thank you
1733,5,i absolutely love pop chips as a healthy alternative to regular fatty chips  the seat salt and pepper and the sour cream and onion are my favorites  i dont crave regular chips at all
1734,5,i luv me some popchips  these are great snack items  i ordered a case and passed them around my office  now everyone is addicted to these chips i have not found anyone that did not like these chipsand they are healthier than the baked chips out there yumm
1735,4,popchips dont taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options  they are light in taste and big on crunch  great alternative to potato chips  im not a fan of the bbq flavor but i do like the sea salt  vinegar salt  pepper alot and sour cream and onion  like the individual bags  perfect for on the go and lunches
1736,5,when i found these chips i was shocked to see how little fat there is in these they taste great and the are actually not bad for you either i told my sister and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them we order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines the office loves them they can be a little hard to find that why i order the online
1737,5,this pack lasted about a month and i sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once as it is my wifes and my favorite so i reordered just the barbecue great snack for  calories ive purchased the reduced fat pringles calorie individual packs before and you get a lot more chips in a popchips bag than from pringles
1738,5,great product all the flavors were delicious loved the fact that the single serve bags were about  calories each
1739,5,i love these chips i have them on auto order every  months they taste great i can not belive the whole bag has  calories i have a bag every day it sure has helped my weight loss by haveing them in little bags so i do not eat a huge amount
1740,5,i am very impressed with the flavors all of them there were a few flavors i wasnt sure i was going to likebut they are really good also the flavors are very intense you are not getting a bland chip im on the monthly plan but ive already had to order them ahead of schedule twice
1741,5,popchips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips i love all the flavors  its also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags
1742,5,fabulous  tasty but not awful for you  ive already recommended to folks i work with  will continue to purchase
1743,5,it is simple these chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands way better than anything baked i highly recommend them
1744,5,the popchips were excellent  had excellent flavor and low in calories  when you eat these  dont need another potato chip
1745,5,these chips are delicious and low in calories  i love the salt and vinegar and the barbeque  we buy them by the case  they are great  thanks for offering them
1746,5,i love pop chips and the variety pack was fantastic  delivered quickly  these chips are filling full of flavor and way healthier than other types of chips
1747,5,i first tried them after a product get together at jelly belly in fairfield ca i was so pleased that i wanted more  well my husband said he saw some at costco so he got a few flavors and boy was i hooked i sent my grandsons in idaho a box of  mixed small packages and also a friend in ohio the same thing  i am on a calorie counting diet along with my husband and we eat the popchips almost every day i like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for youalot better then baked or fried  i am sold and really enjoy themyou came up with a fantastic product  sincerely viki crabtree
1748,4,popchips are very good  im on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks  i think i even like these better than regular chips  the bbq salt  vinegar and cheddar are really good alone and im not normally a bbq chip person  i tend to eat the original sour cream  onion  and the salt  pepper with laughing cow cheese as a dip  i dont really care for the salt  pepper as much as the others because i dont really like pepper in general and these are very peppery  i wish they would replace the salt  pepper with the parmesan garlic flavorbr br also i like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag  it also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car  i dont have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well
1749,5,my son and daughterinlaw told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and i will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on amazon they brought me a bag and i was hooked so i ordered popchips online and they are the best chips there wasnt a flavor i didnt like or that my family didnt like i am a chipaholic and these are better for you and a great tasting chip i highly recommend these to anyone that cant do without eating chips either with a sandwich hamburger or just to munch on middaybr you wont be dissapointed
1750,5,the popchips are great i had heard they were really good and i totally agree i love being able to have all the flavors i like the varietybr the chips were delivered quickly and safely
1751,5,i love popchips and especially when they are in individual portion sizes and a variety of flavorsgood for you and tastes great and are easy to put in lunches or snacks on the go
1752,5,if i had to describe a popchip i would say that its a hybrid of a  potato chip and a popcorn cake  i was a little skeptical at first since i was trying to figure out how they were made if they werent baked or fried but i was pleasantly surprised when i tried them  this variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorites  if youre a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips this are a musttry
1753,5,i liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones  these are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just  just as goodbr br the best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes  i hate rice hates but loved these just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavorand i will definitely purchase them again in the futurebr br i recommend giving these a chance they are a great healthy and quick snack
1754,5,for  calories a bag these are the closest thing you will get to regular potato chips they have great crunch and flavor
1755,5,these are crunchy and very tasty  these dont taste like the usual chips from the store  when i first tried them i could tell right away they were different from the greasy salty fatty chips i was used to eating  these have their own flavor and crunch and i started to appreciate them right away  i noticed i didnt feel so sluggish and icky after eating these  which was wonderful  the combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty  and i love the smaller packages  they really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging
1756,5,the pop chips are really incredible they are very flavorful and crispy my favorite is the bbq but that is just me they are all good i would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health
1757,5,these chips tatse great and the serving size is good we especially liked the variety pack with six flavors
1758,5,i recently received the variety packs of popchips i have them delivered to work and everyone just loves thembr br i tried one flavor delicious next flavor excellent next flavor oh my goodness even better and it gets better and betterbr br best snack in recent memory  
1759,5,very tasty chips healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor in fact the taste is better than most regular chips ive had would highly recommend this product if you had to choose my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar followed by salt and pepper ironically the original flavor was my least favorite probably because i was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer
1760,5,these chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading and unhealthy i might addchips but i was not disappointed in my purchase they arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husbands lunches also we checked for the closest store selling these and it was target  miles away in tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them
1761,5,the reason why i ordered this online is because the only pop chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar  barbeque  i love the sour cream and onion ones  actually i love all of them but its great to have them in the  calorie bag because if they werent i wouldnt be able to stop eating them
1762,5,i love these chipsand my husband does too he wipes them out before i can get to them the variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like they are packaged well and always fresh the bag contains a generous portion ive purchased many times and am never dissapointed
1763,5,this is a great chip replacement wow all the flavors are terrificgood with a sandwich soup or just a late night snack
1764,5,pop chips are the best chips ive had in a long time  im a weight watcher and to satisfy that salty craving i get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only  points  and when i buy a case of them they average i think about   not bad
1765,5,loved the assortment pack everyone in family loves them  low fat lower calorie and all natural simple snack for kids lunch bags it is peanut and tree nut free safe for allergy kids and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat i bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet
1766,5,i am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest nonhomemade chips ive ever had plus theyre healthy only problem is i cant decide which flavor is my favorite
1767,5,i love these chips they are excellent on the weight watchers plan they are only  points per bag which is great for potatoe chips love the single serving bags for portion control also love amazoncom for selling them cant find them in the stores i will be ordering these forever great producta hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbrvfdoopopchips flavor variety pack of  amazon frustrationfree packaginga
1768,5,i love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day  the only thing bad about the amazon price is they are about  for a  pack  that is  cents each  sadly i discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine  for  cents  i would expect to buy them for  a pack if i have to buy  and not from a vending machine  i highly recommend these chips but there is no savings buying the from amazon
1769,5,variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chipspopchips r half the fat and only  calories so a def must buy
1770,5,i am in love with pop chips they are my go to low calorie snack the largest  calorie pack out there
1771,5,these chips are very good wish we could purchase them in our area great chance to try them in this offer
1772,5,these are better than any low calorie chips ive ever had and i prefer them to normal chips they are wonderful oprah even loves them  i would buy this box again and probably will because i love that these are  calorie packs the barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are awesome
1773,4,they were not bad tastingthey served the purpose that i wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy
1774,5,these chips are delicious and each bag only has  calories  they are not fried but just baked and come in  different flavors  for anyone who is dieting but loves potato chips these are great
1775,5,these are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips  not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the whole bag its ok  great product and i would highly recommend it anyone
1776,5,i originally found these at a target out of my home town i fell in love with them as part of my weight watchers plan they are a good snack alternative when i crave something salty i could not find them where i live so i purchased them from the pop chips web site which took me through amazon yummy
1777,5,this is one of the best new products i have ever tried in a long timethese are delicious chips they taste like chips  not styrofoam and are all natural br the barbeque are outstanding as are the plain sour creme and onion salt and pepper i dont love the cheddar or the salt and vinegar they are a bit strongbr br if you are on weight watchers each bag is  points and are a great find to cover the crunchysalty crave if you are not on weight watchers you will still enjoy them my husband loves them my coworkers love them kids love them they can not believe their mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a daybr br overall an excellent product 
1778,5,these taste wonderful  guilt free if you can stop at one bag  will definitly buy again
1779,5,love love love these crunchy little treats  they remind me of munchos but without the greasy tounge afterwards  i dont usually like flavored snacks but these are all great not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste  i subscribe to them so i will never run out
1780,5,whats to say  pop chips are great  kudos to the pop chip makers
1781,5,i really liked these chipsbr br they came recommended from my friend and i really like them the variety pack is great to try all of the flavors  although there were some i wasnt so fond ofbr br the cheddar bbq and saltpepper chips are great the traditional ones are get this traditional no excitement therebr br the chips are great  my brother still asks if i have any around the house but i havent yet purchased them againbr br hint the have the texture of the snack munchos
1782,5,i love these chips so much and i cant get over how delicious each variety is the price here is awesome too
1783,5,i picked up a few bags of these at my local heb and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day the entire stock didnt last even a week for mebr br many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver these however do i tried the garlic parmessan chips and the first things i thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was shortly followed by a garlic flavor combined with a sharp crunch i cannot have enough of these chips im almost afraid to buy a  pack because i know they wont last a monthbr br it also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you i mean they are a potato crisp so you cant be entirely guiltfree but i dont knock myself for going to town i just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when i need to lay low on the snack foods 
1784,5,these chips are incredible enough cant be said about them they are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories
1785,5,i love these chips they always make a great healthy snack when im stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance
1786,5,love these popchips the variety bag was a great deal especially with the  off  tasty low fat just what i needed as a healthy alternative for a great price i highly recommend these
1787,5,i love popchips they taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain  i was introduced to the wonderful world of popchips several months ago and i have not looked at regular chips the same  i do not consume copious amounts of potato chips however i do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers my family enjoys the popchips so much that i purchased a variety pack of  oz bags from amazon  they taste very good and the texture is wonderful although i will admit they are a bit salty  i really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second  make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats because as i stated before they are quite salty i highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative
1788,5,love all the flavors just the right size package and taste great give them a try you will love them also
1789,5,i discovered pop chips a year or so ago and my whole family loves them  we are partial to crunchy salty snacks like potato chips but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload  these are a perfect substitute  great to tide you over between meals or with a sandwich or a moviewatching snack  the small size bags are perfect for not getting too carried away too
1790,4,i love popchips the bag now has only  calories and it bit smaller but if you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great these are for you a bit pricey but worth it
1791,5,i heard of these through my weight watchers magazine they a had a  coupon code so i figured what the heck wow  pop chips are amazing  every flavor is awesome i particularly liked the salt  pepper if you want crunch and flavor  these are for you
1792,1,i dont know why everyone loves these chips they are healthy but taste disgusting only the original flavor tasted good so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea i would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these pirates booty makes popped chips that are way better
1793,3,i am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them mainly fat fiber sugars and then any vitamins thanks so much
1794,5,i shared these with my two older sons then ordered more these are great to put in the glove compartment for after work
1795,3,i decided to try these based on the reviews  they are pretty good  especially for a more healthy option but not sure ill get them again
1796,2,despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks i see no reason to buy them again read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a nonprofit consumer organization for reviews they contain a lot of wow with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer weigh the others as you will but the proof is still in the puddingbr br the texture is their best asset if you like that sort of texture thats about it for me they appear to be an extruded potato product many of those out there with various seasonings that do not impress me either the most basic of them puts mg of sodium into the tiny oz package if you were a deer you might eat them for that alone the fat is reduced that much is true butbr br unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium its no deal but wait baked kettle chips in a oz serving up the fat to g the same as the  of the basic flavor you got oz free on that one the baked kettles possess mg sodium vs  these chips give you g fiber in  vs  in oz of baked kettles this product loses againbr br the only place you might gain is in carbs  for the kettle chips  for these but remember you have oz extra in the kettles nutrition info just about a washbr br and then topping it all  the cost  an oz vs  for baked kettles in subscription wow these wonderful snacks cost  per pound packed as they are the prices will fluctuate but think about the things you can buy for that money instead these are microscopic bags that does not help the environment either  portion control aside with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spicesbr br the most positive thing i can say is the product is packed very well lots of air in the bags to protect the chips and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags you wont have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags so that is a good thingbr br but bottom line expensive junk health food wow
1797,1,two words potato flakes not sure what the buzz about these is try one bag before you buy a case cant be returned
1798,5,in my book you can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse just wish that there were more bbq and cheese flavored selections the black pepper is the bestest yet
1799,2,okbut would never buy them again my husband ate somebr br  i thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call munchosbr br  just not for me
1800,2,ive heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips i couldnt eat them though they just dont taste good to me personally my grandmother loved them though and i gave the rest to her
1801,5,they taste awesome esp the salt n pepper one i love them and they are really healthy the packaging is really good
1802,5,these popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie crunchie snack they are much lower in caloriesfat than regular chips and are portioned controlled i especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips
1803,5,we love popchips but theyre hard to find at our local grocery stores i was very excited to find this variety pack which has  flavors some of which wed never tried before in singleserve packages right around  calories a piece our favorites were the original sea salt  vinegar and sour cream  onion but all of the flavors were good these were perfect for snacks but they also made for easy lunches well definitely order again
1804,5,popchips are an excellent snack i really like all of the varieties i use amazons subscription plan and save some     i get  pack box per month shipped automatically life is grand
1805,5,popchips are phenomenal  unfortunately just not readily available at a retailer near you  ordering online is the next best especially with amazon prime service my dad loved his boxes of popchips  im happy as his daughter to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep
1806,5,i am enjoying the recent purchase of popchips so far i have enjoyed all the flavor choices  the individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if i have a craving for a snack  thanks for the product jean roth
1807,5,im really glad amazon carries these they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too  we havent found a flavor we didnt like yet  ill probably use the amazon subscribe feature to get another  off as we will go through these fairly regularly  awesome chips
1808,5,these are the best chips i have every tasted they are healthy for you  have great flavor  i will buy often i eat  bag a day with my lunch  yummy 
1809,4,this chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover  all the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt
1810,5,great chips  no after tastebr seem to be much better for mebr need to buy the big bags now
1811,2,i decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they werebad idea  i almost ordered two since they were such a good price i am so glad i didnt  we dont care of these at all  the concept is nice chips that are crunchy and better for you than most but they taste funny  they have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable  we have been slowly and i mean very slowly making our way through the  the box brought we still have  left and we received them over two weeks ago so they are not so horrible that you cant eat them its just like forcing us to eat them so we dont have to throw them all away  if you havent had them before i suggest trying them before committing to  bags of various yucky flavors
1812,3,not anything to rave about they were okay i think if i truly had a craving for chips i would just buy and eat regular ones wont buy again
1813,5,amazing concept not fried not even baked popped like popcorn br this is another product for my weight watchers regima each bag is only  points i love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch they taste really good my favorite are the barbque salt  vinegar and the sour cream they are all good though
1814,3,although they are mildly healthier they dont taste as good as baked laysbr br also having a huge box of chips around isnt necessarily healthy because i ended up eating them more oftenbr br they are worth a try but they just seem a bit overpriced even with subscription savings and overhyped
1815,3,theyre okay but not the most amazing thing everbr br  the good br good flavor no too strong or weakbr crunchy but not too drybr plenty of chips in each bag not just filled with airbr not greasy so makes a good onthego snackbr all natural using no artificial flavors or colorsbr br  the bad br sill plenty of fat per bag  grams per bag of the sour cream flavor so dont get them expecting them to be low fatbr tastes like a lowfat chip but with all the fat of regular chipsbr br  conclusion br im  on if ill order them again i have a finicky stomach and so im fine with things that taste lowfat and healthy since those are mostly what i eat but these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked so im undecided on if i want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat the all natural ingredients are what make this chip different and what might bring me back for more its definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself and see if you like them or not
1816,2,i love shrimp chips and i love healthier alternatives as well so i thought these would be a match made in heaven not so much the flavors were too strong most of the time i am a huge fan of pepper but even i had a hard time enjoying the salt  pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is  and this is from someone who currently lives in the uk and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here and too bleh in others the only flavors that my husband and i both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didnt enjoy them enough to want to buy these againbr br i wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have  bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say i will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on
1817,3,i expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips in reality i get an okay taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors chedder and saltpepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips ive ever had if youre just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a  on the list there are much much better brands out there in the end i compare these chips to diet soda vs regular some wont tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it
1818,5,i ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and im so glad i didbr all of the flavors are tasty and satisfying at  calories a bag they are a great snack they quell that hunger for crunchy salty goodness without killing my diet yes they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips but it stops me from eating just a couple more and  bag is really enough to keep me happy ive got a new favorite chip
1819,5,if you are trying to eat healthy like me but love junk food like me these are the chips for you  i have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free but a sandwich just needs something on the side these chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich and are a great snack for only  calories they have no preservatives no artificial flavors or colors no cholesterol  grams saturated fat o grams trans fat and are gluten free ingredients are potato flakes potato starch safflower oil andor sunflower oil rice flour sea salt they would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack i ordered them on the subscription plan a case a month but might have to add an extra shipment everyone i have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more
1820,3,popchips are good and great for diet snack but on amazon the price is nearly double the cost of costco an  pack is only  at costco
1821,3,so for a healthier snack it sure is salty but then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories each bag is  calories with  sodium intake for the daybr br the chips are not bad i just wouldnt get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt
1822,3,i really wanted to like these all the reviews made it seem supernal and well as advertised its not fried nor bakedbr br however even though it is advertised as being healthy but still with plenty of flavor that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt i only looked at the nutrition facts after i felt they were too salty and i discover that a cal bag contains  dv of sodiumbr br im not a health nut nor am i trying to diet these were my first food purchase from amazon and i bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller however i just couldnt get into these chipsbr br i realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals tastebuds and so i will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor i personally enjoy chips where i can taste some potato as well
1823,5,i happened upon this item in my local deli and being curios i decided to try  they were fabulous better than the regular chips by far  i gives you satisfaction of crunch and flavor in a potatoe chip  great great find
1824,4,i first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors then i picked  and ordered them on subscribe and save  each on alternate months  its much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you  these chips are crisp delicious and taste salty mmmmmmm good each bag has  mg of sodium they only have  calories in a bag and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving unlike other  calorie snacks where you get  almonds or  crackers  now i can have chips every day at work for lunch no guilt  the salt and pepper variety is absolutely delicious  the plain is great for dipping and the barbecue is full of flavor  the salt and vinegar is very sour if you like that type and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good just not my favorites  a very good deal on subscribe and save chips delivered to your door individually bagged and ready to take for lunch  convenient  nothing bad to say about popchips
1825,5,the chips are good with fast service but i ordered a case of popchips flavor variety pack and received  bags all barbecue flavored
1826,2,i love amazon and i love the reviews from people ive been introduced to alot of great products bc of the reviews but this time total complete let down popchips having  stars is just down right perplexing the should not get more than a  but generally  i sorta want to give it a  but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so i through in the extra pointbr br i ordered these thinking thatd theyd be maybe a slightly better version of baked lays man was i wrong ive tried most of the baked lays flavors my gotos at first were  original baked lays and  sour cream baked lays since those are my favorite regular lays but then  i discovered bbq baked lays and seriously those are fantastically great bbq baked lays are packed with so much flavorbr br these popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips literally they do because they arent as good as baked lays i can definitely see eating much less of them which could be a benefit but i say just use portion control and zip lock bag a bunch of baked laysbr br im trying to think of ways to go into more detail but theres really not much more i can saybr br summarybr br how do popchips taste like slightly burnt air chips its sort of a weird taste takes alot of getting used tobr br would i suggest buying them no if youre eager to try them i say buy a bag from your local grocery store a week or so after i ordered these on here i saw them at m local krogers so theyre definitely expandingbr br nutrition information  bag  oz g   calories total fat  g  sodium   mg  total carbohydrate  g  dietary fiber   g  sugar  g protein  g vitamin a  vitamin c calcium and iron   br br if you buy a big bag of bbq popchips and big bag of bbq baked lays here are the nutrition information sidebysidebr br pop chipsbr serving size ozgabout  chips calories  total fat  g  sodium mg  total carbohydrate g br dietary fiber g  sugars g protein gbr br baked laysbr serving size ozgabout  chips calories   total fat g   sodium mg  potassium mg total carbohydrate g  dietary fiber g  sugars g protein g vitamin c  calcium br br so these two are very close but baked lays wins because it virtually has not sodium since potassium mg offsets the sodium mg leaving g of potassium plus theres more fiber and more vitamin c and most importantly they taste betterbr br i for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that baked lays has potassium in it is a huge benefitbr br at the end of the day make a decision for yourself but id strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both baked lays and popchips i can almost guarantee you that baked lays will win hands downbr br hopefully amazon starts selling wellpriced variety singleserve bags of baked lays soon for now i found one from a seller but the price seems a little high but there are  bags instead of  a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtvdhiosmart mix variety pack count baked lays classic baked cheetos baked ruffles baked doritos nachos cheese  rold gold tiny twists pack of a 
1827,3,i have not ordered yet my question is from the description it is  bags at  ounces how does this equal  ounces in total weight
1828,3,i first tried the bbq flavor at a restaurant which was good then i was carried away with the  fat part which made me pay without realizing my mistakebr br the salt  pepper is ok only ok after trying another one i changed my mindbr br the bbq is good but not that goodbr br the rest is pure trash i did not like them whatsoever nor my other  friendsbr br the price is wayyyyyy high and not worth it for a small single serving as others such as utz is wayyyy better and cheaperbr br  starts is too much for this overmarketed less of flavor and overpriced snackbr br avoidbr br  stars off bad flavorsbr br  star off pricy as sh and not worth it
1829,5,ive tried using a toastermicrowaveconfection ovenstove to make these things myself but i wasnt able to i even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to pop i verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named mat his name has one t which seemed a little strange to me but to no availbr br i contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product i dont know why they couldnt just mail or at least email me some popping instructionsbr br luckily i think even rawunpopped they taste pretty good people look at them funny at first but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag completely unpopped
1830,3,the flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar thee two varieties just make one go yummm ewwwwww tossed out those verities but the others were very good less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor still a good item but i wouldnt suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with
1831,4,the sun chips are an ok substitute for the usual potato corn whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted  they are not nearly as unpalatable as i thought they would be  have added them to my heart healthy diet regime  all are good except for the multigrain style which has the texture of a sheet of plywood
1832,1,i bought those chips after reading good reviews but i was very disappointed with the taste it was nothing like what i expected granted that i expected good old kettle cooked potato chips i bought the flavor variety pack and there were many flavors i did not care for it was worth trying them but i am not going to purchase them again in the future
1833,1,pop chips are basically a horribly overpriced version of munchos which are baked potato chips and have been around forever period
1834,1,i bought these chips thinking that they are all natural per their description of no preservatives no artificial flavors or colors  when i received them i checked the ingredients and they contain yeast extract which is synonymous with msg yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid  i will never purchase this product again
1835,2,the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor  all the other flavor was just soso
1836,1,i was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out they seemed pretty tasty so i bought a couple bags at target the ones i bought barbeque and salt and vinegar were awful i ended up throwing away most of them neither i nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down the ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling dont waste your money
1837,1,these chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco for  you can get a big bag with  times the amount of chips compare to these oz bag chips so for  in safeway you can get  worth of popchips these bags are so tiny its like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something for me i never gain weigh i rather go buy big bag of chips these are expensive ripoff chips will never buy againbr maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazoncom maybe elsewhere is cheaper but chips as junk food shouldnt be that expensive compare to local stores
1838,3,im not as crazed about these as everyone else but for a lowcalorie snack theyre fine  they certainly dont do much to curb the appetite though im typically just as hungry after finishing as before  not like with protein chips also available through amazon
1839,3,the texture is like rice crackers which i personally dont like taste isnt too bad but every single bags are too salty even the original flavor id give four stars if they make low sodium chips the salt is one of your worst enemies i bet it does more harms to your body than msgs
1840,2,these chips are too saltybr i like the crunch size of the bags and varietybr but i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are
1841,4,the cheddar tastes a little weird but that could be personal preference the salt and vinegar is very strong but tastes okay other than that  salt and pepper is yum  barbeque is good too  plain is plain  if youre a die hard potato chip lover and dont care about calories dont bother with these  however if you want your salty snacks and dont want all the calories these work  id buy them again
1842,5,i have been on weight watchers for about  months  i have lost  pounds  the most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up  popchips do that for me  they are only  points plus on weight watchers  they go great with every meal saladsoupsandwichetc i can not live without them  so i say buy buy buy and buy
1843,4,love these  im not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy  a little like pringles but much tastier
1844,5,i am so happy to have discovered these chips i hate stealing a phrase from another product but they melt in your mouth i have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointmentjust getting ready to place another order for these  calorie per bag air popped chips do try them people
1845,3,this seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips small single serving bags  i really like the plain unflavored popchips but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste  i plan to set up subscribe  save for just the plain
1846,5,love the chips nice   calorie snack reminds me of munchos but less greasy flavors are good salt  vinegar least favorite and theyve started shipping apothank you and my family thanks you so they dont have to get the package and reship made my day
1847,4,i wont get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on amazon however i will talk about the product overall it is very well packaged the popchips bags arent flimsy or too loud you dont have to worry much about these getting smashed while theyre in a bag with heavier items they hold their own when trying new foods snacks flavors i tend to purchase a variety pack so that i can sample everything let me tell you these chips are packed with flavor but its not in my opinion too heavy or saturated my favorites are the barbecue potato and cheddar potato by far very realistic savory flavors then there a couple that are not my favorite but tasty with time the sea salt and pepper potato and the sea salt and vinegar potato are a bit strong at first and if you dont like those flavors i would say you wouldnt like those chips but they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients original potato and sour cream and onion potato are also tasty but nothing to necessarily rave about for me at least i would not call this a diet chip but a healthy alternative to over processed chips i saw a few complaints about the popchips being too salty or high in sodium the chips can come across salty to a person who doesnt consume much salt but per bag these popchips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt overall great buy you just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you and for me it is
1848,5,wow these are remarkably tasty chips  i discovered them through weight watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fatbr but they are high in flavor and umamibr i am now a big fan
1849,5,these are great because theyre only  calories per pack and are just as good if not better than other chips out therebr br the original style taste exactly like munchos but dont come with the high calorie count  the other flavors sour cream  onion salt  vinegar salt  pepper cheddar and bbq are all delicious as well
1850,4,we liked these  quite good even if theyre healthy   calories   whole fat grams a bag my favorites are the plain the others are very strong flavored very zippy
1851,5,i had seen these advertised on the hungry girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip  i was given a free bag at some event  found them to be tasty  the single serve bags in the grocery store were  for a  oz bag  buy them from here and they are  for   oz bags same amount of weight watchers points if you get two cases shipping is free get them now before the states force the sales tax thing throughbr br all of the flavors are really good  i even liked the bbq which i normally do not like in a chip the cheddar have a good cheese taste and the saltnpepper have a kick they do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fatcalorie chips
1852,5,love these chips  they are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all  there is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped  the popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light they are only  calories a bag but there are lots of chips in the bag so its a great snack  the ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added  fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq
1853,5,i love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting with popchips single serve pouches i can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only  calories the single serve pouches also help in portion control the larger bags are a slightly better value but unless you have astounding self control i would recommend the single serving option they are that good they easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips ive ever had and at half the fat and calories how could you ask for anything morebr br the variety pack comes in  flavors original sour cream and onion salt and pepper cheddar salt and vinegar and bbq my favorite flavors are salt and pepper and cheddar my least favorite is salt and vinegar but i dont like any salt and vinegar flavored chip my only wish is that this variety pack contained the parmesan garlic flavor which is very good but extremely hard to find in local stores i have ordered the parmesan garlic flavor in a  pack here on amazon but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety packbr br at  after the subscribe and save discount each bag costs only  cents this is a bargain for these great tasting healthy chips and i highly recommend you try them
1854,5,i was a little hesitant to try these especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive however i liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and i figured they would be great for school lunches quick snacks etc i decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them they could be donated  i ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more or less and thought that would give us a good sampling  after deciding we liked most of the flavors we decided to try other ones as wellbr br despite the flavor preferences these chips do not taste like cardboard  at first taste they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect i think this is a good thing because it means they are not heavilyladen with oil  the  oz bags are  calories each as well which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories trans fat etcbr br i have included a summary of opinions below from myself friends and family for each flavorbr br sea salt  vinegar  great the absolute favorite flavor for everyonebr bbq  very good im not crazy about bbq to begin with but would say this flavor is sweet bbq everyone else loved thembr cheddar  very good probably close in preference to the bbqbr original potato  good but a little salty seems to fluctuate somewhat between bagsbr salt  pepper  good everyone liked them but preferred other flavors morebr parmesan garlic  good but overall was  you definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latterbr sour cream  onion  not so good no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bagbr br i know taste is a very subjective thing but i hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try i did get them at a reduced price through subscribe  save and shortly after my first order amazon had them on the gold box for an even better price  i think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account
1855,5,these are the greatest potato snack products ive found  only  points for weight watchers  really crispy and tasty  all of the flavors are great  my only complaintits difficult to open the little bags  i need a pair of scissors but i guess that keeps them fresher for longer so its a great trade off  i would recommend these chips to everyone
1856,4,i really like these chips  they have a different texture than regular potato chips but i still find it really tasty  even my boyfriend who is often averse to all things healthy and low fat will gobble these up rather quickly  the variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much  i find the original version to be a little bland by itself and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people
1857,5,i am potato chipaddicted i dont only enjoy potato chips but i also enjoy any type of potato product this product really hit the mark for mebr br i consider these a fullfledged snack each bag is packed with chips they are moderately seasoned and full of flavor the consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake  but theyre crisp and crunchy not puffy they have a distinct potato tastebr br the best part each bag clocks in at only  calories and i repeat  these are not a simple  calorie snack what you get here is a full bag of chips whats great about the content vs calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a  calorie bag of chipsbr br my personal favorites were the sea salt and vinegar and the original the barbecue flavor is sweet not smoky the salt and pepper cheddar and sour cream and onion flavors are standard fair but the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and i did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the nextbr br these are a great product well manufactured and a treat to eat ill definitely buy more of these in the future
1858,5,wow these chips are deliciousbr br theyre low in calorie and carb count i can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oilsmothered grocery store chipsbr br the sour cream  onion salt  vinegar and cheddar are my favoritesbr br if youre weight conscience want something healthy or just want something that tastes good buy these chips you wont be disappointed
1859,5,this doesnt taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips but its still very goodbr considering its low in calories and its only popped  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze driedbr these pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats but with a good amount of flavor and crunchbr i like it a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quickbr i keep then in my room in case if i ever get the cravings for chipsbr all the flavors that come in are good too no complainsbr br the package also arrived fast and its pretty cheap i would recommend people who is watching calories to get this
1860,3,bought these based on the glowing reviews   stars and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price first of all  oz per bag equals about  or  chips per bag which is not many while this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories fat or sodium the fact is that  of an ounce is not much and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time  due to the discounted price each bag was around  each not to bad until you figure that equals  per pound at the regular price its about  per pound as far as the taste all of the flavors were good none that i absolutely disliked but none that really rocked my socks either bottom line at the discounted price i paid i was not disappointed but if i had paid the regular price for these i would have felt cheated
1861,5,it felt weird ordering  bags of chips off the internet that i had never even tried before but i am so glad i did they are delicious ive tried  flavors so far  have loved each one these are a win 
1862,3,i actually purchased these i myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring from the reviews i thought they was more like munchos they are not bbq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok according to the family plain is horrible salt and vinegar was the best overall my family gave it  stars i will stick to kettle chips
1863,5,we have these suto delivered  they are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size  great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors
1864,5,these are my favorite chips the bbq and salt  pepper are the bestbr br the texture of these things rockbr br all nicely packagedbr br gluten free if you care i dont but some have commented on that
1865,5,these chips are tasty and low in calorie  if you are gluten free they are a great option as a togo snack  we love them
1866,5,the product arrived quickly all bags and chips were in placeand safe d these chips are delicious and only four ww points
1867,3,i like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that i can munch on with my lunch i love the flavors and the packaging is perfect worth the buy  the price is right the flavors are just what they want portion size is good thus its a win win situation for me and them
1868,4,overall the chips were very tastey my pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations try it and see for yourelf enjoy
1869,5,this chips are really good and its fun getting the variety pack  now are they as good as regular chips  probably not but theyre also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips  given that these are a healthier version if you want chips i would highly recommend them
1870,5,i ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal this size bag is perfect for snacking the assortment of chips is great theres something in there for everyone
1871,4,love pop chips the assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties i  wanted did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great
1872,3,i really like the pop chips but i do not like all the flavors the only ones i like are the originals  the rest of these flavors were really not good  at least not in my family  i gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them  sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals they are the bestbr br this snack originals fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specificallybr br i will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others
1873,5,delicious light and full of flavor its difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is but bbq is amazing i was impressed with the packaging but i cant imagine it is too cost efficient or ecofriendly that is my only complaint great product and guiltfree snacking
1874,5,love these popchips  they are all great  do not care for the salt  pepper flavors  i wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didnt include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase i make and ive made alot  the bbq original salt  vinegar and sour cream  onion chips are superb
1875,5,i love popchips they may take some time getting used to if youre used to the oiliness of potato chips but theyre only  calories per bag buying a  pack saves you money per bag but youre sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around
1876,3,good texture they are crunchy and not sharp will not cut mouthbr br flavor they do not taste like potato chips if i had not just opened the bag i would suspect they were stale but no this is how they taste many others have remarked about the odd flavor as wellbr br healthy good for dieting i suppose low oil and low saltbr br i will not be buying these again
1877,5,im very picky when it comes to chips ive gone through so many but this one really hits the spot it has just the right amount of crunch with just the right amount of flavor its also great to know that youre not eating something thats bad for you with  calories a pack its definitely the ideal snack
1878,4,i loved this product and it was better than what i thought it was going to be my favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor yum yum but i hated the cheddar and salt  pepper ones
1879,4,i am not going to lie i will give you the strait dope these things are like crackbr br i will polish off about  pages of these easily in a day hence the freshman  that i have gained lolbr br if you love these i suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker
1880,5,really really tastybr much healthier than almost every other potato chipbr a variety of flavors consider this a huge samplerbr br sea salt  vinegar is crazy sour personally i think they overdid it on the vinegarbr its hard to stop at one serving but i take this as a sign of a good snack p
1881,5,my subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged  i love the fact that i receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying the way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so rightbr br thank you
1882,5,these were awesome they have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling i bought the variety pack to try all the flavors didnt care for the salt and pepper but loved the rest will definitely buy more
1883,5,it is so wonderful to eat pop chips  i am a loyal fan and will continue  tasty and healthybr br the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices
1884,5,what can i say if youve had popchips in the past and love them then no better place to pick them up i love these chips and have bought them without an issue from amazonbr br thanks
1885,4,i won them off a penny auction site my  year old likes them plenty i dont think there is any potato flavor they taste more like ricecakes to me but are ok the salt and vinegar is strong holy cow
1886,1,these chips arrived in terrible condition the box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me the box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well which gives you an idea of the shape of the box the chip bags inside were pretty flat there were no chips but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for this is how many of the packages looked flat there were a few with edible chips but not many not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box common sense should have been used
1887,3,next time i will order only the original flavor  the other flavors did not suit me  too much of an aftertaste
1888,4,i do love popchips they work well with weight watchers taste great and the crunch cant be beat this pack has many flavors with the salt and vinegar being my favorite my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddarbr br the one i miss is sweet potato it is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors but arent included in this variety pack
1889,5,i was looking for a quality low points weight watchers ww crunchy salty snack  i cannot stay on a diet if i feel deprived wws website had a coupon for these pricey chips  never had a popped chip before so i gave it a whirlbr br wow the best crunch and flavor of all reducedcalorie chips i have ever tried  better than other brands popped chips i have tried since  i need portion control help and these little bags for  points do it for me  the variety pack helps to break up any monotony  my favorite flavor is the bbq  i am not a vinegar kinda guy  the salt and vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me  love the rest of the flavors  i love salt so the saltiness is just right for me  thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue  i need these snackiesbr br lost  pounds so far in  months eating these  will probably buy them by the case in the amazon auto order system to save on shipping  i guess i plan on being a lifelong fan until something better comes along
1890,5,these are such a treat when you are craving that salty crunchy snack and the multibox where you get a variety of flavors is perfect share it with son so they dont get stale but not much chance of that  one of my  points plus weight watchers snacks that i dont run out of
1891,2,the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue which was the reason we purchased them in the first place  i had to give the others away  i wont be buying this again for lunches although the sizepackaging was great  i just wish the other flavors tasted better plain salt pepper etc werent really kidfriendly
1892,5,got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store this was a great buy thanks amazon
1893,3,these taste alright but they are health food by no means at least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices this products is made of processed potato byproduct and is natural by no means the calorie savings isnt even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil if eaten in moderation because of the healthy dose of balanced fats in my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits if you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip if you feel these taste better than the above then by all means enjoy but dont be tricked into believing these are healthy at allbr overall  stars for taste and  stars for the marketing scam that they are
1894,5,i have subscribed these chips they are so tasty not dry or oily cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row
1895,5,i love these chips they are so delicious it is so hard to eat just one bag all the flavors allow you to taste them all  my favorite flavor is the cheese ones go ahead and try them  they are so delicious
1896,3,i purchased these because i was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips well theyre fairly healthy absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy however i just couldnt get over the taste which i can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn if that undercurrent of burnt flavor wasnt there these might have been more palatable but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect also the seasonings werent consistently strong cheddar was ok bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chipsthe flavor was straight from a bag of lays however i was very disappointed with the sour cream and onion which was just too light in flavor and the vinegar and salt which didnt have as strong a tang as i would have likedbr br overall i would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didnt mind a watered down version of a fried chip however i just couldnt stomach them i gave away the unopened bags to coworkers none of which were impressed either but theyre not on dietslucky dogs for now ill stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers
1897,5,i found these chips originally at a local market  however i have been unable to find them since  whew  what a relief when i was able to locate them  these chips have so much flavor theyre not greasy and they are crunchy  i am a chipaholic and these are by far the best chips i have ever eaten
1898,5,these chips are great delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips i have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious i found amazon to have them cheaper and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor all the flavors were to my liking the only con about this is that they are addicting you are warned i purchased these through amazon
1899,5,these are the best chips ever i will buy them again wish more stores had themthe plain chips are my fav
1900,2,these chips taste so dry and gross i would rather eat carrots or something than these they just didnt satisfy the salty craving and werent worth the calories
1901,5,im sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highlypalatable junk food junk food is delicious but it aint good for you conversely healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but i honestly think that its just something that requires training and acclimatizationbr br i really like popchips they dont taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if youre someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods each bag is only  calories which is very helpful for portion controlbr br for me the taste is great its not amazing but it isnt awful sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are theybr br ive tried small bags of popchips from the vending machine which i recommend doing before you buy a case i havent tried all over the flavors until i bought the case and i was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box fortunately my boyfriend and i disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors i dont like and vice versa it works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually dont have the tastes however if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time i can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you wont like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do likebr br if youre not accustomed to the taste of healthy food you might not enjoy these at first either way pop chips are worth a try probably not by the case though i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them
1902,4,i bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success there are  different flavors of chips  of them were really good the last one though was not the salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes maybe some people like it but not us all in all though they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric contentbr i would definitely buy a box with the flavors that i wanted
1903,4,this practically falls under the category of healthy snack  well almost  single serving bags mean you wont be overeating and the fact that these arent in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus  nice crisp crunch  the bags are filled with air which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole  on the case that i got though two bags containted nothing but broken bits  of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips  some no broken ones at all  i also noticed that you dont find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as ive experienced when eating other chipsbr br purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value  some of the flavors are incredibly strong to the point that i dont like them so i wont be ordering this mixed case again  salt and pepper just tasted like pepper making this a very hot tasting chip  the seasalt and vinegar is really strong on the vinegar which is a taste i dont enjoy  i love bbq flavored chips but again this was kind of strong  i probably wouldnt purchase the bbq ones in the future but wouldnt say no if someone offered them to me  the original is really bland compared to these others but not badbr br the ones i liked the most were the sour cream  onion and the cheddar both with milder flavorsbr br id give this  stars if i liked all of the flavors  definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order
1904,5,yes people these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor but they taste good i am not a big health food person ill take the grease if it makes it taste better these are x better than those baked chips my brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked i mail him while deployed only draw back to these chips they are definitely not for dipping
1905,5,tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which werent that great good healthy snack without giving up the taste so glad i discovered these salt and vinegar are my favorite  calbag g fatbag
1906,5,the chips were delicious i didnt care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great didnt have any guilt eating this healthier snack
1907,5,i eat a bag of these every single day  they are the best tasting good for you snack everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked
1908,5,cheetos ever since i was kid were one of my favorite snacksi mean who wouldnt like them you cant go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try im not a fan of unbearably hot foods but i do like things with with a kick and since this had jalapeno in it i was assuming it was hotnot so much if you eat mildly hot foods this shouldnt bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food i didnt even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery jalapeno flavor i would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane i buy mine for a little over  dollars for this bag overall i hope they decide to keep this one cause they are amazing and yes girls like these kind of snacks too  love
1909,5,for you spicy lovers these jalapentildeo cheetos are for you the taste is great and i admit i did not expect them to be this good one day i picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week i had about  empty bags in my trash cans office snack a must unfortunately this product is too good to last and i fear it will meet the same fate as wasabi funyuns rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale roster so enjoy these awesome jalapentildeo cheetos for as long as they last
1910,5,these are quite tasty and delicious i love thembut the prices here are ridiculous did i say ridiculous oh so ridiculous but im here to rate the product not the price stars for the product
1911,5,a little costly but they are good and fresh too not stale at all would recomend to any cheetos fan
1912,2,i bought this because i had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places i thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro however this is very poorly designed i could not open it whatsorever even after searching through reviews after reviews finally my genius boyfriend found the solution basically you will need to open it from the bottom you will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it you will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while theres water in the pot if any one who is reading this still having problem opening it let me know ill try to explain it better there but anyway this is a pretty useless product for its productivity but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own and wants a prettier fridge you can make you own with a cup or any container filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herbso unless you have money to waste dont buy this useless pot
1913,5,this product works great for me  i hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after  i put some herbs mostly basil in here and they were fresh for a few weeks  no leakage probs either the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flushbr this thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when im ready to cook
1914,5,i have had my herb savor for a few weeks now and i was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad so i could tell you how long it takes but it never happened for the first time ever i used all of the herbs before they went bad i have not had any problems with leaking everything closes up nice and tight on mine plus this thing just looks really cool
1915,3,i bought this as a gift for my mother she likes it but says it is hard to open when she unwrapped it i remember having to help her figure out how to open it it took me a minute if you have arthritis you wont be able to pry this open
1916,2,i have had the herb pods for about  months  they are a great concept but have a poor design the plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on  im  constantly afraid that im going to break it  the pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water  unfortunately i dont use them half of the time i buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth
1917,2,with no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit the first few times are an act of frustration  when i finally realized that if i grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield about one third from its bottom and squeeze the sides the bottom lip pops out nicelybr i will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley basil ect  the company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendlybr all in all i like it i took away one star for the lack of instructionsbr br  after a few months i have thrown this thing away  it became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs i use most  i have seen some newer larger units that dont have the issue with opening it like this one hasim going to order one of thesebr br i no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to  stars
1918,1,despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open i was confident i knew the secret so would be fine not so no matter what i did couldnt pop off the clear plastic lid instructions showed the bottom part screwing off didnt husband couldnt even do it and he opens everything for me he finally got it open only held about half of the aspargus which is what i wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from progresso that we both can open note to self pay more attention to what people are saying
1919,2,the reviews on this are so true great idea but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side even once i figured it out i keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid  but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure i would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top not the side
1920,5,ive had trouble storing fresh basil because i learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge  my cat is attracted to anything in the plant family with disasterous results  this keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it
1921,1,i rarely write reviews but these pods are so awful i was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like i did  the little green plug barely stays in  even after twisting it  so the water is always sloshing out  and the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design  it is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when i tried to open one of the pods  and i can attest that those plastic shards are sharp  if you are able to actually open the pod be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom  even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs which they dont really do they would not be worth the aggravation or cost  like another reviewer said just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top  works perfectly and costs nothing  please dont waste your money on this
1922,3,ive had a couple of these for a few years but find that i dont use them all that often because their size  design limits their usefulness for bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch and its difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it it works great for asparagus but only for smallish bunches and if the spears arent too tallbr br more often than not i simply use a canning jar   of water with a plastic bag over the top which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access these pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bagtoppedjar however and the clear front makes it harder to forget whats in therebr br they are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over and the little drain port is fun to usebr br but it only works for small bunches
1923,3,i got one of these for xmasand to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive containerbr br the main problem is the container is difficult to open it does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get gobr br the thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it you dont need to open the bottomjust squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out firmly dont worryyou wont break it it is pretty sturdy plasticbr br the real issue is when it is filled or has water in itits difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spillingbr br ive just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill portthen popping itbr br preparaplease read these reviews and improve on the next design
1924,2,even with the tips shared on how to open it its still pretty difficult to open  i guess i have weak hands my husband usually has to open it for me and even he doesnt do it with ease  i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod  its much easier to open and can hold more  i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half
1925,2,saw this on oprahs favorite things and thought it would make a great little christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as i do since they come in packages of three i kept one and gave two away i couldnt open mine to clean it so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time i thought it was just too tight from the factory my basil looked great after ten days but when i went to use the basil i could not open the pod husband not homeneighbor not homedog missing thumbs i tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle okay maybe a little harder than lightly i was pretty frustrated luckily i had emptied the water so i only had a small mess to clean up the pod went into the garbageforcefully i checked with my friends friend  had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear coverit also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it friend  has now been warned there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments ive read were not the only ones who have had this problem i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrappingtape on music cds ive gone back to my old methoda widemouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabricit works
1926,2,i wanted very much to like this product but after using it for more than  months i just cant the clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off especially when the pod is filled with water its also difficult to get the cover on especially when youre trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro the oring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesnt seem to seat correctly after removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs ive never again been able to get it to be watertight consequently every time i use my podi have to store it in a bowl or else im mopping up water from my fridge shelf on the plus side the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day
1927,5,my wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism i gave it a try it seemed to work well enough for basil even freshening up some wilted leaves but the seal the deal moment was when i put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where i mostly forgot about it  weeks later we were gone for  weeks on vacation i opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut i doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy  to justifybr br its always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods
1928,5,i bought one of these about  or  months ago  and i love it  i have kept a combination of rosemary thyme and parsley  they have all kept fresh for more than  weeks  no brown spots no rotten leaves  just perfectbr br i highly recommend this product  no problems with leaks or the plug not holding
1929,5,i am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about  months ago i am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time it not only gives more options when i am cooking by having fresh herbs available but also its easy to clean and stores easily in my small fridge i really think this is a must have product for everyonebr br and if interested in a larger one i attached a link to the company site prepara where you can see all their cool and innovative productsbr br 
1930,1,ive been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herbvegetablesalad bins inside to grow vegetables and i thought the prepara herb savor pod looked like the perfect precursor wrong the detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere similarly the plastic plug at the back does not hold a good idea a nicelooking product but poorly executed refrain from purchasing  plastic bags are much much better
1931,1,i threw this away after about a week of ownership  couldnt get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over and half the time i couldnt get it off at all  it only works for long stemmed herbs and all need to be about the same height
1932,5,actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two thats enough reason for me to buy before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and i would have to toss them out this saves me money and a trip to the market
1933,2,the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus that was why i purchased it thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh in reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short  the ad is misleading ill keep it for storing herbs but asparagus is out of the question
1934,5,i got this in my christmas stocking from my stepfather  were both foodies and try to cook like chefs in our homes  i love this product  i use this one for scallionsgreen onions which until recently always went bad before i could use all of them  sometimes i threw out more than  most times  or  but i honestly cannot remember the last time i used every single one  that is until now  inside the savor pod they grow and keep for weeks easily more than   i am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so i can actually use them for fresh herbs  storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea  the only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned but wrestling with it is ok with me so long as i can use all my product before it goes bad
1935,1,after i enptied the can i noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded of course i was afraid to eat the fruit so i threw it away i am waiting for a response from native forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful one would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic they would use safe canning i will post an addendum w their response
1936,1,after reading a previous review i carefully inspected the cans when they arrived the cans were immaculate and very clean so i felt relieved after cooling in the fridge i ate the first can the fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth i eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me only days later my teeth and gums were infected and i had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad he found infection and i had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before i was finally ok again after about  weeks sheesh needless to say i threw out the remaining cans of fruit the problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were st rate and shining clean quality control must really suck im all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided this is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there i would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health
1937,1,this product was a complete disappointment tastes like mushy pineapple there was no papaya taste
1938,1,i will never buy this item again i was addicted to it until the last order fruits had foul smell tasted rotten was the expiration dates forged
1939,5,i was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit which i normally wont touch  in particular i adore papayas and mangos  the fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice  the easy pulltop on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work so that i can have a fruit snack easily even if i was too busy or forgot to bring lunch  so far i havent gotten a can that had any problems  the watermelon isnt crunchy  of course not  but its good and certainly not slimy
1940,5,this is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream  it is my husbands new favorite dessertbr br i dont find the texture offputting  of course is isnt as crunchy as fresh fruit but the taste is greatbr br if i can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an a in my book
1941,3,i tried tropical pineapple it was delicious i gave a bad review for tropical fruit salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it i think the two of these were competeing for the flavor i see now thats what i think it was probably not a bad product at all sue
1942,5,my  yr old granddaughter and i cannot get enoughbr and it is good for you
1943,3,this fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky there are certain fruit that shouldnt be canned and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine much of the soft fruit i had to discard albeit this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothies then you dont have to taste the slime
1944,2,edit  i just noticed each bag is only  pounds not   my review is not  stars instead of threebr br first off as you can probably guess by the pictures these are sour gummies  that isnt said in the description  also each one is about  to   inches in length and  inch widebr br texture and flavor  the came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings  the sourness is average not overwhelming but not too little  where i took off the  stars was the flavor most important part  as i chewed them a few different flavors hit my tongue none of which tasted that great  i couldnt make out any of them inparticular not good at that anyways but the combination was just plain strangebr br i could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other  away to nephewsniece  after all they will eat anything sugar coated right
1945,4,im a big fan of the dirty martini  but i simply cant eat enough olives to keep upbr br love this stuff  not quite as tangy as dirty sue but still very vibrant
1946,5,we have reorderd this product many timesmakes a great dirty martinidelivery is prompt product well packed
1947,5,this is an excellent product  we always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis  now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better
1948,4,the last case a different brandwe ordered from amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case  however the boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini
1949,3,what are the white flecks floating in my recently ordered bottles of dirty martini olive juice
1950,5,if you like bloody mary s and dirty martinies this is a must you wont be sorry im so glad i found this product
1951,5,this stuff is outragous it is simply the best olive juice on the market i tried another brand and it did not come close to boscoli this stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives i would highly recommend this product
1952,5,ive tried a few different dirty martini mixs etc but i prefer the actual juice from the olive jar well as any experienced dirty martini drinker knows you soon have way too many olives and not enough juice boscoli family dirty martini olive juice is the real thing i usually buy  of the oz bottles and thatll last me several months shipping is pricey but the bottles come not only packed in peanuts but also bubble wrapped they pack em in a sturdy cardboard box and tape it up real well i live in a rural area and usually get my order in about  days fantastic experience all the way around
1953,5,he never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat just buying the juice makes alot of sense
1954,5,excellent service  price for the product order shipped quickly  received in good condition will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good you really cant beat the price
1955,2,i purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis i was pretty disappointed the juice is very strong i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini the ratio was  part vodka to  part olive juice it was way too salty the olive juice was over powering i made a decent dirty martini with  parts vodka  part olive juice i would not recommend this item
1956,5,the olive juice i purchased was not only inexpensive but has a great flavor  i have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis but i could not find anyone that carried it  thanks amazon
1957,4,this product is great if you want a dirty martini i highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine
1958,1,ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid  read the ingredients  the main label says olive juice by no such thing  i am going to suggest that amazon take this off the website
1959,2,this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important  i prefer to drink my grey goose straight however on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice  this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice  its not worth it  the after taste is worse
1960,5,we use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say
1961,2,sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill this is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anticaking agent into your food and no iodide the anticaking agent isnt event that effective so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit stay away
1962,5,love this balance blend of oils  especially in mix batters such as  pancake  cornbread cake  etc  a good oil to ingest 
1963,5,i used to buy these at world market however they discontinued them br so i am forced to buy them online  the rose and violet flavors are good however i did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for mebr br i carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really goodbr also the tin is very cute
1964,5,cant live without these little jewels  not only is there a surprise in the middle but it takes me right to the french countryside while enjoying them
1965,5,a family favorite  these are really unique treats  the wonderful taste of flowers  the violet and rose are great  orange blossom wasnt to my liking  the company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years  they are made in a small french town that was featured in a movie called chocolat
1966,5,i love these  i love any floral flavored product the best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever  offer these but dont tell the flavor  the reactions are youtube worthy
1967,2,this candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at allbr br i ended up throwing most of it out because i dont like so much sugar i prefer strong flavors like a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkyoenealtoids twin pack mints wintergreen  tinsabr br the center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because its an anise seed  but there are better licorice candies out there like a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbjtzlktwizzlers twists black  licorice pound bags pack of a
1968,5,i ordered these candies for the first time and i am hooked they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming i really enjoy them highly recommended unique candy
1969,5,the flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt were all accustomed to although describing such subtleties is difficultbr br one noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt  mg per  teaspoon versus mg per  teaspoon of conventional table saltbr br another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is not iodized  as our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet
1970,4,i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again and considering its healthy use for sure
1971,5,i bought this because my husband wanted to try the french sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show  the grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it  i did not realize however that it is not iodized and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily iodine
1972,5,i really liked the taste it is well priced too it is a great and healthy alternative to table salt i even used it on salad
1973,3,i have never had sea salt before but the  sodium free got to me  it has to be an acquired taste because i dont really like it  perhaps if i used it regularly i would not want to go back  and perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well
1974,3,the pork chops from omaha steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem
1975,5,this is a fabulous gift i ordered  and kept one to tryand they are awesome the presentation is great chocolates delicate creamy crunchy and tasty easy to eat not heavy for a mass produced line this is a real winner better than most out there in its price range love the  different flavors will buy again great hostess gift
1976,5,i ordered this for a friend at south carolina for christmas i want her to try some italian chocolates lolbr br the item was arrived earlier than expected but nevertheless it was well packed and only melts on her mouth she totally loves itbr br three different taste and flavors of ferreros guarantees to give three different yummy joy mmmmm
1977,5,this item was received early  it was packaged well and in excellent shape  this was a gift and i am sure it will be received well  after all ferrero chocolateswhats not to likebr br thanks for the excellent service  would use this seller again and would highly recommend
1978,5,i bought this as my first pack of kcups its definitely a good buy assortments are always a little more expensive this one is very well priced you get  of each and one of them only has  thank god they picked decaf for the small one great coffee if i hadnt discovered club keurig i would still be buying these
1979,2,i too was a little disappointed with the mix of the donut sampler in my case i had  of the  were decaf  but i guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the amazon warehouse deals section  all the kcups had a best used by date of   i was happy about that atleast
1980,1,i have had the regular donut house coffee before and enjoyed it but i had never had the flavored kind  i was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and i could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff  i dont drink decaf so i knew that some of this pack would not be used  i figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf  i was wrong  this sampler pack was a joke   of the cups were decaf and  of them were the standard house brew  i got  cup of chocolate glazed donut and  cup of cinnamon roll  now i will not be using most of the kcups in this package because it was again mostly decaf  this is what they consider a sample packbr br  donut house regularbr  donut house decafbr  donut shop regularbr  donut shop decafbr  donut house chocolate glazed donutbr  donut house cinnamon rollbr br some sample
1981,1,my husband just bought a keurig coffe maker in the box was samples his favorite was donut shop i ordered the  kcup for him i was so disappointed out of the  kcups  were decaf giving me  kcups of each of the  flavorsbr i also ordered the wolfgang puck sampler i got  flavors  each how cool is thatbr i would order donut shop again just not the sampler
1982,1,i ordered this because i have had the donut shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered  after receiving my order of the sampler pack i was very disappointed over half my order was decaf coffee and i only got  cups of the flavored coffee which was the main reason i ordered it  i love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or the lack of variety pack
1983,2,i got this on the warehouse deal so i wasnt expecting much however be advised you will get no regular donut shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf i love the flavors of all of these though so thats ok but i will think hard about getting another variety pack
1984,5,well see how these work out in our family over time im not sure that i am disciplined enough to make good use of them although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog they appear to be good for what they are a very tiny but healthy reward right now i can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands a training tool i was surprised at how tiny these treats were they seem to taste good enough but they are miniscule they are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide maybe  as thickbr br my dog was a little annoyed but took it when i gave it to him that was yesterday today he came in excited to get his treat looked at it as if to say youve got to be kidding then he took it and ate it a little later i offered him another one he put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats but when he didnt get one he went back and took this onebr br i think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands treats thats stretching itbr br they may also be good for my sons dog who rarely gets treats because shes overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed at least she would get a treat large treats take her  seconds shell probably inhale these one second maxbr br i like the fact that these are lowfat with no added salt no refined sugar no artificial flavors colors or preservatives it says treats baked with natural peanut butter
1985,5,i use these for training treats  i have a large and small dog and this works for both of them  they are all natural and my pups love the taste  i highly recommend these  i also tried the three dog bakery apple oatmeal woofers and those were a big hit
1986,3,i have been using these treats for quite a while and both my dogs love them but both dogs are also way off their food and have been for quite some time and both have been acting kind of offnothing major but just not exactly right well i just happened to quit using these treats for a week or so and noticed both dogs came back to life and theyre eating like crazy i cannot for certain pin it on these treats but its something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off kilter
1987,5,ive never been addicted to candy  in fact i dont usually like candy with the occasional exception of halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet  but these little guys watch out  it might seem like a  pack is a lot but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue  a  pack will seem like theres a shortage of caramels in the world lolbr br i tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and i just cant  to me its like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like ahhh thats itbr br i can only hope that the gubment doesnt put a tax on it like cigs because then id have to put myself into an institution
1988,4,i am a bzzagent and i recently received a package of these to try  i have to say that i absolutely love the flavor of these candies  i am usually not a big candy eater but i have to say that i was really impressed  the werthers chewy caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that i couldnt stop at just one i usually stop at one for most other candies  they have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them  i like the fact that they have some great ingredients like cream and butter but i had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them i am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients  as far as the taste goes my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy so i can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family  it was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert  if you are having a party these would be great set out in a candy dish  there will be none left by the end
1989,5,great candy as always from werthers original candy hard or chewy caramels are but two of the candy they make that is outstanding it seems that you can not keep it in stock and are always out or just have a bag or two left to sale
1990,4,i reviewed werthers original chewy caramels caramel chocolates and creamy filledbr hard caramels as a bzzagent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to thebr original hard candies  still has that great unique caramel flavor from werthers butbr now in a chewable form  i prefer the original hard candy as those little gems lastbr a little longer but these are a nice second choice
1991,3,if you like werthers hard candies you may like these the pretty good caramels but they are hard and really sticky like do i have all my fillings stickybr br eating a bag now but i wanted caramels and these really arent the are closely related but so different in terms of texturebr br not my cup of tea if you like your caramels really hard not hard candy hard but still you may love these if you think caramels should be soft and chewy you may notbr br now i just tried warming them up and that really helped almost tempted to raise it up to  stars dont microwave it though that turns them into a bubbling mass of goo
1992,5,i received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift  its so good that i keep buying this same brand mix when i run outbr br i cut the farmhouse waffles recipe in half so thats  cup farmhouse pancake and waffle mix  egg  cup water  tablespoon melted butter and its more than enough batter for  waffles in a fullsize belgian waffle makerbr br easy to make and very tasty
1993,5,nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by stonewall kitchen  my mom complained about the price but i think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancakewaffle mix  the waffle comes out golden and crispy  i was using the presto  flipside waffle maker
1994,5,i have been making belgian waffles using the stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix for over three years  my waffles are undoubtedly the best ever  i like my waffles light and crisp  i cant stand a heavy soggy waffle these just melt in your mouth  i have made homemade waffles but i have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix
1995,4,this is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one i use a bit pricy but if you dont mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle combine this with a waring waffle maker and you could be in waffle heaven
1996,5,i have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work  so you have to add an egg  a little butter  it is well worth it  i am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime  they are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside my family loves loves them  the only thing different i do is instead of the extra  tbsp of water they call for i add  tbsp of vanilla in place of best waffle mix
1997,5,i had read some favorable reviews of this pancake mix on amazon quite a while ago  i had never ordered any but i came across a can of it in one of those outdoorcamping stores last christmas  i have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder and can honestly say i have never enjoyed the struggle so much  pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually i buy the cheapest i can find or at least one that i am familiar with  i tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part but every now and then i get curious of a brand like this one it just so happens that when i visited this camping store i was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along  unfortunately it wasnt till i left that i realized that this mix was not one of the just add water ones that we all know and love  the best ones always needed your own addition of eggs milk butter etc and this one is no exception in that respect  so instead of enjoying this mix on the trail i have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen  i really dont know what it is about this mix that makes it so good but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes i have ever tasted from a mix  they are very light fluffy and flavorful and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself  if you have a pancake fiend in your home i would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix its cheaper here on amazon than i paid for it and well worth it in my opinion i have had lots of different kinds over the years and this makes some truly delicious pancakes highly recommended
1998,4,i was expecting great things based on the reviews while it is good its not great i believe my waffles made from bisquick were just as tasty as these and this costs quite a bit more the instructions are very easy to follow though and i do like the canister for storage
1999,4,i love this pancake mix  i bought my first can from whole foods market about a year ago  my only complaint is for all the work you have to put into making them at least the pancakes anyway you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch  you have to add your own egg whole milk and melted butter  one thing i have noticed about this mix is that its relatively difficult to burn the pancakes  it is however easy to overcook them
2000,5,what can i say  they are wonderful and the highlight of each weekend  ohhhhhh   use soda water for the liquid   even better 
2001,5,i usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that doesnt taste off to me  this mix is the best  my family and i love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy
2002,4,this is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make
2003,5,my family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix the texture and taste is the best out there especially when using our waffle maker you can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish your price is great and delivery cant be beat we recommend it to everyone
2004,5,we use the farmhouse pancake and waffle mix to make delicious belgian waffles in our a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbxmluwaring wmka pro professional stainlesssteel belgian waffle makera we have tried waffles using a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbqpzgekrusteaz waffle mix belgian oza a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeobfegolden malted all natural waffle  pancake mix ounce containers pack of a a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbsbujamaple grove farms waffle mix belgian ounce pack of a and the waffle recipe from a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbjytsyaunt jemima pancake mix ounce boxes pack of a in a highly unscientific blind taste test involving my three children the farmhouse pancake and waffle mix was the unanimous choicebr br i make a triple batch according to the instructionsalthough i use only one tablespoon of melted butter instead of threeand the batter stores well in the fridge for up to four days the triple batch makes   waffles on our waffle maker and they are crispy light and golden brownbr br this brand is slightly more expensive per waffle than the normal grocery store brands like krusteaz but our family thinks the taste is worth it as an aside my son has a soy allergy and this mix is free of soyunlike most other brands
2005,5,i love belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch  they are really good and im fussy  i havent tried them as pancakes yet
2006,1,i used to buy bobs red mill organic  grain pancake  waffle whole grain mix until i saw all these rave reviews about stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix i decided to order from amazon and tried it this morningbr br this pancake mix is very fine and powdery when i made my pancake mix the mix was all over my kitchen floor the mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing the waffle recipe from the label asks for  tbsp of melted butter which i never use that much when i use the robs red mill pancake mix i could only make two perfect  round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be  pancakes the pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review however i also tasted a lot of chemicals in it i guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient looking at the ingredient label did i realize it has more chemicals than other brands and i do not understand what artificial flavor it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like cinnamon and apple etcbr br in short i am going back to my robs red mill brand at least i know what i am digesting in my stomach
2007,2,didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemimas from dominicks the pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup
2008,5,these pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like i am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money splurge on this and the good maple syrupit really is cheaper than going to dennys or ihop where a meal for two will be  minimum
2009,4,let me start by saying my family loves this stuff  it has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla  it cooks up nicce and light  my problem with this product is the recent price increase  it was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey  allinall i would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like  after that i would suggest playing with recepies on your own
2010,5,my family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend  my daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone i fix them for thinks they are outstanding
2011,5,i bought a belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and i was then confronted with the question what waffle mix do i use somehow hungry jack felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance i read the reviews here on amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price stonewall would be a great choice bang nailed it the first time now i dont know if my waffle maker is particularly largedeep but i get only two and one half waffles out of each batch following the recipe on the label i dont dare water it down to try to stretch it out and i figure i only got about  batches of waffles out of one can the costperwaffle is steep but these have never failed to come out light on the inside slightly crisp on the outside and they have never stuck to the waffle iron grudgingly even though i see the price has gone up a dollar per can i will be reordering but if it goes up any higher i may have to try another brand
2012,5,im sorry not everyone likes this mix but we love it it is like going to a gourmet restaurant yeah  a gourmet waffle restaurant the waffles taste and turn out great and so easy hard for us to believe but it seems its not for everyone
2013,4,this is the pancake mix we go to when we dont have buttermilk in the fridge dont think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh to make alton browns buttermilk pancake recipe  this stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far it might cost more but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes
2014,5,stonewall kitchen products are a big favorite at our house  this pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat  we add fresh blueberries to them and top them with the stonewall blueberry syrup which you can buy on their website  they make wonderful jams and jellies too as well as sauces and flavored syrups  try this pancake mix though you wont be disappointed
2015,5,this is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by amazon so i bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase  it makes the best waffles every time i have used it and that being said i am sold on this product  i will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make  i would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical
2016,5,i have been using this pancake and waffle mix for about  or  years and i have to say this is the best  the waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside  ive tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix  i use the waring pro waffle maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime  i follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results
2017,5,this is the king of pancake mixes  easy foolproof and delicious it makes the best pancakes ive ever tasted  weve been buying it for several years and the pancakes consistently come out light and delicious  simply add an egg buttermilk and melted butter  cook them on a nice hot skillet for a yummy anytime meal
2018,5,makes perfect delicious crisp on the outside and soft on the inside waffles in minutes worth every penny
2019,5,i purchased this mix to use with my new presto flipside belgian waffle maker and am very pleased with the results  it took  cups of this mix to make  large belgian waffles and they cooked to perfection after only  minutes  the flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like bisquick  ill be buying more for sure
2020,5,i received this as a gift a few weeks ago  it is by far the best home made pancakes i have every had  the taste and consistancy is excellent  blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in  you pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion
2021,5,makes very good light waffles seems to be exactly the same as carbons golden malted waffle mix only this is more expensive
2022,5,bought a great waffle maker two years ago  tried many recipes for making waffles nothing really pleased the family well until i followed a recommendation to try stonewall waffles  believe me it is not like bisquick as i thought it might be it is so much better i was shocked  and well now the family loves them and looks forward to sunday waffles every couple weeks  i even double up the ingredients so i can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them  these can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast  forget the eggos even as frozen waffles these are greatbr br what do i like best about them  the waffles come out light and fluffy  they are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries nuts or whatever toppings you may choose  in no way do they feel heavy or soggy  they are a snap to prepare and take just  minutes in the waffle maker lastly the whole family loves them  so despite the higher price it is well worth every penny
2023,5,bought this mix along with the cuisinart waffle maker  delicious  we followed the directions and it made only one belgian waffle  the next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount  good flavor and easy to use
2024,5,i have a waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use i tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mixbr br it was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor  loved the malt flavor that came throughbr br i will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out
2025,5,this mix makes great tasting waffles  a little extra work and expense but worth it  need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make  full waffles on my new presto flipside belgian waffle maker
2026,4,i got this as a gift and liked the flavor but i wasnt crazy about the texture  i like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not imo aunt jemimas buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and its so easy to makebr of course the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and allbr overall i think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money  and it still requires you to put melted butter milk etcbr i am sticking with my own recipes and aunt jemimas if i am in a hurry
2027,5,stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix is our favorite  consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor  the  ounce cans are a good value for the quality i highly recommend this product
2028,5,this mix is the kids and family favorite it tastes like vanilla its wonderful for pancakes or waffles
2029,3,stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix is definitely a mouthful in name but in taste not so much  dont get me wrong its not bad but you could find any number of mixes that taste just as well and some even better  i know my taste buds arent the same as yours so whats just decent to me may be great to you  i also wish i had bought just one can instead of  huge  ounce cans  i finished the first can ill give the other can away and ill continue trying other mixes until i find the best mix out therebr br so far i seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles  my preference is for waffles over pancakes but this didnt make it on either count  i even tried adding things to it but it didnt really help  maybe its just me  try it if you like but remember buy only one can just in case youre like me  you can always buy more
2030,5,this waffle and pancake mix is delicious  you can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them  they are the only pancakeswaffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking
2031,5,my family loves waffles we have been trying to make homeade waffles for a while but when my second child was born we got tired of all the mixing and measuring we chose this batter mix because the reviews were so great they take no time to mix the dough comes out a bit runny but if you fill the bottom of the waffle iron completely you get the fluffiest belgian waffles we are using the chefman rotatable iron i highly recommend this batter if you like waffles quick you can add a little cinnamon and sugar too to spice it up
2032,3,i love this pancake mix can not find this exact one in any stores so i always order online and keep in stock at home all you do is mix with water i add fresh chopped bananas or strawberries for a healthy option and swap syrup for honey and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast
2033,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeeastonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix ounce cans pack of abr  the family said they were the best that i had made the  grandchildren ate all that was served to thembr the parents who i have served pancakes to for a long also said they were the best they have eaton it was good to see the little ones clean up their plates
2034,5,we have pancakes once a week and this is our goto mix it is incredibly easy to prepare and i add a handful of chocolate chips pieces of bananastrawberriespeach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan no need to buy different flavors you can customize it yourself
2035,5,we first had stonewall waffle mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago  we have been using it ever since  the flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world  we wont ever go back to bisquick for our waffles
2036,5,this has become a breakfast staple for our home now nearly every sunday morning we are making pancakes weve got the vermont mapel syrup eggs sausage or bacon and were set for the day with a just a light snacktype dinner use bettermilk for the absolute best results
2037,5,great mixed for belgium waffles family thinks its the best  must try it and order it from amazon  i let friends know to use this product
2038,5,i found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix  star i had to read those reviews two of them seem like ads for robs red mill and the other one didnt make any sense you must be looking for pancakes or waffles so do yourself a favor and give these a go they are delicious
2039,4,the entire family loved this pancake mix it was easy to make and tasted great we tried it with syrup powdered sugar as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote i would definately purchase this again the only problem is my family wants this every weekend and i have to double to feed my large family it gets expensive quickly so i do not order it as often as they would like
2040,5,we love this pancake  waffle mix  its hard to please everyone but this item does the trick  crispy light tender yummy
2041,5,this was the best pancakewaffle mix ever wonderful for breakfast or dinner it was a great price and worth it my husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles i made and ate them fasti could hardly keep up definitely recommend stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix you do have to add a few ingredients but it is well worth the effort
2042,5,this product is great  just add egg water and butter i used oil  i will never make waffles from scratch again
2043,5,we made this purchase based on our daughters recommendation and it is as good as she promised we have a new flipstyle waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast we add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous
2044,4,i have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet  i have also made them from scratchbr i like my waffles with no sugar in them because i dont like too much sugar  this mix is very good  waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare
2045,5,we received a gift box that contained the stonewall farms pancake mix and they were out of this world they are the lightest fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste  and the price on amazon is a big savings over ordering from stonewall farms  dont shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time
2046,5,this is a great waffle mix i have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge i have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best i totally dont understand the reviews about the bad taste and all the chemicalsread labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients there are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need such as levening and when you use real butter not the tub butter that contains water and other nasty stuff these are the best waffles ever
2047,4,this lands in the gormet category for sure  having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home  the price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of thatbr br they cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time
2048,5,i use this as the base for my waffles  use  small bananas mashed t cinammon t vanilla and  cup gratted pecans and then blend it all together  you need to let it cook a much longer period of time at a lower then normal temperature and you need to cut back on the amount of water used you need to know what the consistency of the waffle mixture should be before you attempt this recipe so that you can determine the amount of water to use  this is a somewhat tricky recipe since its easy for the waffles to stick and pull apart  one banana makes it easier but ive had some success with three bananas  bananas are better overripe
2049,4,im not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix  its quick easy and produces delicious waffles  yes its pricier than some of the other mixes on amazon but i think its worth it
2050,5,this is a great mix i mixed it with milk instead of water  just follow the directions
2051,5,this is my favorite waffle mix it can be used to make pancakes too but you have to add milk and we dont usually have milk in the house  you have to add water  egg and melted butter for the waffle recipe  we eat waffles about once a weekbr br apart from the fact that it tastes great it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in it has no trans fat  some pancakewaffle mixes such as krusteads which also tastes really good say they have no trans fat per serving but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients there is still some less than than  percent trans fat per serving  stonewall has nonebr br we used to have a store that sold it locally but now we dont so i am glad we can get it onlinebr br the can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batterbr br we just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next
2052,5,i originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack  when my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately  it is super yummy waffle mix  the waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them  here i am on amazoncom placing yet another order for this waffle mix it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyones favorite breakfast item
2053,5,we are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better  sunday is pancake day at our house and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup  this mix holds fresh blueberries nicely  dont overmix the ingredients and you will get nice fluffy fruitfilled or not pancakes that are absolutely firstrate
2054,5,we first received stonewall pancakes as a gift we have ordered them x on amazon who has the best prices highly recommend this product will return here to buy more
2055,5,i bought this on a whim because i found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it i didnt expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix this is so much betterbr br its easy to use and makes moist fluffy pancakes that are to die for i am never buying bisquick again
2056,5,i have used this product for a few years now this being the first time from amazon im glad it was there this is by far the best pancakewaffle mix on the market bar none 
2057,4,the pancakes were delicious but they werent as fluffy as the ones i normally make  next time i use this im going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps
2058,5,i found these at a super gold box pricing one day otherwise i would not have looked twice at  pancake mix  now we are hooked  nothing compares to this mix  ive tried every box in the store for our belgian waffle maker and these top them allbr waffles are nice and crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside they are so dense they dont absorb syrup or toppings  i will buy this over and over again
2059,4,on a whim i picked up a twopack of stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix recently enticed in some measure by the already positive reviews hereand i will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantrybr br i really did not expect that this easytoprepare mix would yield waffles better than the fromscratch recipes i had been using but now the waffle iron is stashed within easy reach after being banished to the recesses of the cabinets for the last few yearsbr br being able to whip out crisp airy light malty waffles does wonders for ones popularity in the kitchen and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go
2060,4,no matter how you mess up the recipe this mix still makes my family happy in the sunday morning 
2061,1,i have an immense love for pancakes  i have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year i did not write this review prematurely as i wanted to give the product a fair chance  i tried it with whole milk  i tried it with buttermilk i tried it with blueberries i tried it without blueberries  it is by far the worst mix i have tried thus far  the flavor is not good seems like it needs more sugar  with blueberries it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them  i really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix  i honestly would rather eat pancakes from mcdonalds  dont waste your money  robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and i believe it was cheaper may be better for wafflessince im stuck with two cans i may try thatugh
2062,5,i hope amazon restocks this item alwaysi cant stand the other brands out there since it got this brandand the price is right at amazon to
2063,3,the best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes  i really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easilybr the batter cooked up nicely and the texture was ok  however i was very disappointed in the flavor  there were stong overtones of chemical flavorsbr i will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future
2064,4,heavily touted by the reviews decided to try  mix is good but not great  probably wouldnt buy again
2065,5,this is the best pancake mix  ive sent this to several people and they all love it the twopack makes a nice little gift
2066,3,been curious about stonewall since reading all the amazon reviews but not sure about spending  for a pancake mix  the other day found a big can at sur la tab store in san francisco for only  so i thought why not this is my chance to try  i was so looking fwd to saturday morning and made it first thing todayall i can say is underwhelming nothing special  i tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and healthier butter it was alright but not great esp considering the price  then i doctored it up a bit added madagascar vanilla flaxseed and psyllium which i usually do with my pancakes tasted a bit better overall rating  stars just ok stuck with the can so well eat it but will not purchase again  i will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference it probably does i highly recommend garveys organic pancake mix also here in amazon tastes so much better and fluffier  if you like  whole grain pancakes we also love kodiak buttermilk mix also here on amazonhealthy hearty and so good even my kids love itand best of all its just add water makes it portable we even took it with us on vacay to hawaii
2067,3,when i read the reviews from other customers i was excited about ordering and trying this mix this morning we made waffles with both stonewall kitchen mix and bisquick the waffles from stonewall were ok and so were the waffles from bisquick the waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the samebr br the agreement was that stonewall kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost furthermore it is not available in our local super market whereas bisquick is stocked this will be a one time purchase for us
2068,3,i am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world  i like to make my own or get them at the original pancake house which has the best buttermilk pancakes i have ever tasted  i decided to try this box mix variation even though i am not a fan of box mixes  the stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but thats where i ceased to be impressed  these pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over  then again i guess im one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway  theyre ok but not worth all that money
2069,3,every week i make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those i make with jiffy mix as jiffy mix costs a lot less i will not likely order this product again
2070,1,this expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake  a less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste no doubt  its a yucky product
2071,3,this mix makes nice pancakes they smell rich and vanillay but you dont actually  taste it as strong as it smells i wont buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close im just as happy using a krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water no eggs or milk or flour necessary heck if you want that vanilla smell and taste add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batterbr br edited for grammars sake
2072,5,recently my life partner was complaining about our same ole breakfast every morning  that is when i discovered that he loves pancakes i was aware that he liked waffles weve only been together almost five years  i on the other hand have never cared for pancakes  i loved my grams waffles but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference i just didnt care for pancakes  she did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them because my daddy enjoyed pancakes so i learnedbr i was in central market on saturday when i ran into a coworker and her husband  they took me by the hand from the baking products isle to the jams jelly syrup honey isle  on the top shelf was the very best pancake mix  stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix i saw the price and took a deep breath it was twice the price of the mix i had just been contemplating purchasing on their recommendation i tossed it in the cart along with some real organic light amber maple syrupbr this morning i fixed three small  inch diameter pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste i needed to knowbr well i dont believe i have ever had real maple syrup before in my life just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup i have never liked that stuffbr that pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was delicious it was the pancake mix that made the differencebr now i am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker  after tasting that light fluffy pancake i can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix  these reviews are making my mouth water with anticipationbr i will never buy any thing else
2073,2,this mix produced some pretty bland pancakes  followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes  considering the ingredients that needed to be added it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch  i debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters i have left maybe some pumpkin pie spice but that wont help the thicken up the batter
2074,5,im not sure why but this is our favorite pancake  waffle mix  just tastes the best to us
2075,2,makes okay pancakes only marginally better than the standard bisquick recipe they are edible i should say that my kids liked thembr br not that great in my opinion
2076,2,we didnt care for this product at all it seemed to have a funny after taste to it wasnt worth the cost we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty
2077,2,what am i missingbr br this mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake ive tried adding vanilla and cinnamon i use real maple syrup on top i cook them in fresh bacon grease the pancakes are still just blah its like they absorb and negate the flavorsbr br the pancakes cook ok the texture is fine just absolutely no flavorbr br wont get this again considering pitching the rest of what i have
2078,3,i bought the mix at the same time as the oster  waffle maker and have been pleased with the results light well baked waffles that tasted good  my problems with the mix were first the expense secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it  it simply smells too goodbr br i am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it
2079,5,i hope amazon always carries this product too i have ordered it twice excellent product for the price yumo
2080,1,part of me wants to ask for a refund i bought this package of k cups because i wanted a mix of teas when i got my package i was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package i know they substituted based on availability but i think its completely misleading to substitutes with products that dont pertain to the packaged theme i got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog disappointing
2081,1,this is not a summer samplerbr br the majority of this sampler was hot including hot eggnog hot apple cider hot gingerbread coffee hot caramel apple and golden french toast coffeebr br sound like the perfect brewed over ice kcup to you  this was the totality of iced drinks vanilla iced coffee peach iced tea and unsweetened black iced teabr br additionally there were only  varieties rather than the  listed on the descriptionbr br i literally thought they might have mixed my summer drinks for holiday drinks but it was clearly labeled summer samplerbr br even worse this item does not generally qualify for a refund  beware
2082,1,thought i was ordering summer tea flavors got leftover winter garbage i will not buy from this seller again i hate iced coffee much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors i cannot believe i just spent that amount of money on crap that i will not ever drink should have waited until walmart carried it does keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements yes i know it says flavors may be substituted that would be fine if they were more teas if i had wanted gross iced coffee flavors i would have ordered suchbr br on the up side the peach tea i received was very good otherwise dont waste your money
2083,1,i got two teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were holiday coffees and apple cider  spicy eggnog gingerbread bait and swtich  the only redeeming factor  amazon was great and issued me a refund
2084,1,there should be an option for a  star rating because that is what i would rate this itembr first the sampling was to include  varieties but included only   it appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box i had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as island coconut was out of stock it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor  same thing for the half and half lemonadebr second the order was not balanced  of the  flavors i did receive only  were coffees the remaining  were teasbr the concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail  the order is being returned today
2085,3,we definately got a nice assortment of kcups but were really looking forward to trying the peach tea which was not included in our shipment i overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of eggnog french toast and a third winter type flavor slightly misleading from what is pictured
2086,3,dont get me wrong i wanted to try the holiday sampler mostly coffee but i ordered the summer sampler with teas  there were just a couple peach teas sweet teas and unsweetened black teas  i didnt send it back because i wanted to try the holiday sampler  almost everything i got was the eggnog coffee apple ciders ginger bread coffee and french toast coffee  the box was labeled summer sampler so im sure that this was an accident  i didnt contact the seller because i ordered it while i was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button  so seller if you see this review message me and we can talk
2087,1,really amazon nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of egg nog and when i am not craving egg nog in the summer its gingerbread id really like dont buy this it sucks im probably just going to toss it if there was the ability to rate this with a negative number id say 
2088,1,i do not consider gingerbread spicy eggnog caramel apple cider spiced apple cider summer items you cleaned off your self at my expense  very disappointed
2089,2,i was hoping for the gift box instead i got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of k cups  dont get me wrong if the price is right then i have no problem but the price was a little misleading  i was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box not a warehouse box  it looks like a mix and match of k cups that fell out of other packages or were returned buyer beware
2090,4,as a new keurig owner im trying as many sampler packs as possible to determine what both my husband and i like the mostbr br although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other crazy cups purchases have been received in i am enjoying this variety thoroughly  it is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the followingbr br southern sweet tea unsweetened black tea raspberry sweet tea peach sweet tea sweet lemon tea half  half tea and a few different iced coffee kcups  additionally there were a few seasonal island coconut which my husband lovesbr br i would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of kcups but at a price of over  cents a cup i cant justify the cost  however this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxesbr br if these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers this would be a very ideal gifthouse warming present for these hot summer months  i dont mind them not being in a gift box but i could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price
2091,3,the teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after unless you really like strong teabr br its a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk
2092,4,very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer
2093,4,i havent had a chance to try these out yet but i thought i would go ahead and mention that i received  each of the following  flavorsbr br  sweet rasberry black iced teabr  southern sweet iced teabr  sweet lemon iced teabr  french vanilla iced coffeebr  nantucket blend iced coffeebr  gingerbread coffeebr  eggnog coffeebr br fortunately im okay with this as i was wondering how the gingerbread and eggnog tasted as well you might feel differently though and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced kcups
2094,4,there are some types i really likeespecially southern sweet tea which is actually a lot less sweet than southerners really make it  the raspberry and peach are also good and not overly sweet  urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damagebr br i did not care for the herbals and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortmentbut i found friends who like those flavorsbr br it was to taste test and it was fine for that  i dont think i will buy assortments again as i have found what i really like
2095,4,i got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although yuban is our everyday coffee well this was a surprise nice and flavorful not bitter smooth and maybe not as strong as yuban in the same amounts the was all there if they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price i would buy more but as is its very pricey
2096,3,i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks havent tried the veggie ones yet the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk taste better
2097,5,this was a new product to me  they were very tasty crisp and surprisingly delicious  i was very pleased with this product
2098,5,i was very pleased to stumble upon this brand as it is difficult to find healthy snacks for families that dont contain gmo ingredients these were a big hit with kids and grownups alike added bonus that they are low in calories and glutenfree i would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor as well as the brand in general great new company
2099,5,this product was a gift to a far distant relative  it arrived right on schedule in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket  i cannot attest to the food personally but she loved it
2100,5,i always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter  and since i also had discovered i was allergic to wheat i wanted and needed an alternative  i originally found these kame rice crunch crackers in kroger supermarkets  from the first bite i loved them and i wished i had discovered them years ago  the plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste and they are perfectly crunchy and light  ive occasionally had a hard time finding them so im thrilled that amazon is now carrying them  give these a try they are delicious
2101,5,these things are addicting and low in calories and fat too  i love the wasabi flavor
2102,5,i would recomend this product for its fine qualities and taste really good very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake
2103,5,these crackers are a great snack no cholestoral and they use sea salt very crunchy so its like eating potato chips but better for you comes in different flavors but i prefer the plain i have found that the salt content is different on some purchases sometimes very salty and sometimes hardly any salt must be a problem on the production line these crackers become addicting but its ok cause rice is good for us
2104,5,im so dissapointed these are unavailable right now i love these crackers with cream cheese  its my favorite snack i hope they become available again soon i cant find them anywhere
2105,5,i got  pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time to me they taste just like corn nuts they are quite hard so i wouldnt recommend to anyone who doesnt like hard foods they are crispy and delicious snacks tho will buy more d
2106,4,this is an excellent product for the nongluten diet  theyre good alone as a snack or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches  excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten  only criticism  wish the price would come down
2107,4,not as good as sesmark savory rice minis but these are available at least they are very good more healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch mmmmmmmm   
2108,5,first time buyer of kame rice crackers and im very impressed these are very light crisp and flavorful they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts fruit etc unfortunately the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source right after i purchased the dozen packs the price per dozen increased  to its present  fortunately i have enough to last a while but assuming the price stays the same these are my last kame
2109,5,crackers are great  was glad to find them there is a good selection of flavors  my favorite is salted but there are other choices
2110,5,local availability of the plain variety of these crackers has been unpredictable with stores trimming inventory and dropping all but the highest volume skus buying on subscription makes it affordable and so far reliable
2111,5,these rice crackers are truly delicious wcheese or peanut butter  also i can eat crackers wo gluten as i am allergic to wheat eggs gluten and bannasbr this is my favorite snack on sunday nights they come promptly and save me money thank you j wolf
2112,5,i love these crackers  perfect snack for when i need something saltycrunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack  i eat them a lot to hold me over between meals  the price on amazon is great compared to my local markets  highly recommended
2113,5,bottom line these crackers are a great snack  ordering by the case saves some money compared to the  charged locally  whether plain onion or sesame ive never tried the wasabi these are a low fat reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it  the only sad thing is that i first ordered them in  for  per case
2114,1,i ordered kame rice crunch crackers plain i received kame glutenfree rice crackers original all natural  unfortunately they have soy products in this cracker and therefore i cant eat it  this looks different from the picture that came with the crackers i ordered  apparently i cant return the box of crackers
2115,5,i too have begun to drink only penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water  i find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website  and i get free shipping  i feel better overall and wish i could get this stuff by the gallon  great product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being
2116,5,you can purchase this for  including free shpping straight from pentas websitebr br i really enjoy drinking this i can see a difference with my everyday life
2117,1,you wont believe how many ways this product has saved my life  i only gave it one star because im so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out  when i can afford another shipment ill jack it back up to  starsbr seriously folks some waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away  not penta it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal restoring your bodys natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration  but it wont weigh you downbr other things i have noticed about this productbr br i accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it and when i pulled it out it had better receptionbr i was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it until i discovered that it improved its functionalitybr i threw some jumping beans into the bottle and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigeratorbr br hey if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff you wont even need soap  it comes at a price but its so superbr br if you are tired with the uninvigorating boring old swill other people call water or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah thats so bad they cant attach a higher market value to and youre so over the cheap readily available and monitored crap your mcburbia proffers then look no further
2118,5,i bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity  i have a vpi record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection  you basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent  this water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap oh no water with all its impurities  you wouldnt believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned  my wife can always tell when i am playing vinyl instead of a cd it just sounds more aliveshe says  this water is highly recommended for this purpose  i may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about
2119,5,i love this water  it is very uplifting  i feel better drinking it  it is arsenic free flouride free chromium  free chlorine freeand mtbe freesomething about reverse osmosis and medicinal grade oxygen really works  at work we are no longer allowed to drink soda in our classrooms so i bought some penta water i am hooked  i like the one liter size bottles  i wish you would sell those also  i was lucky to purchase this at dorthy lane market  buy this water
2120,1,the site doesnt list the ingredients for their products online  had i known the product was full of trans fats i would not have ordered it  watch your labels  partially hydrated  partially hydrogenated  you have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public  in the future i will not order a product that doesnt list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchasesbr br did try the product and found it tasteless  no heatspice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth must be from the wax  i was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead  the sad thing is that they do not have to use trans fats to get flavor  they just dont care
2121,3,i first tried these in a bundle of other glutenfree products and it was so fresh so i decided to buy it in bulk and the expiration date was only three months i ended up given most of it away because i didnt have time to eat all of the  packages i received the taste is ok not too sweet but i found myself getting sick of it fast
2122,5,these are my most favorite nut snacks sunflower is my absolute favorite but the almond cashew very buttery and rich and seasame are really great too  have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them  great for the kiddos too
2123,5,i love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid it has been very hard to find in any stores i am so glad i found it on amazon the shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition it still has the same flavor after all of these years try this candy if you love coconut you will love it too
2124,4,this freeze dried ice cream is great it tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package for a fraction of the price after receiving this i understand why it costs less than the astronaut kind the packaging stinks on icebr br normally freeze dried items are packaged in air tight foil type packages so as to not permit light and most importantly air into the package air is the enemy of freeze dried items because it contains moisture the product arrives it is in an air tight can which you need to open with a can opener inside the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will not keep air out of the productbr br it gets worse the paper wrappers are not only not air tight but they are also all slit open every serving is slit open in several places the can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible this may or may not keep the product fresh but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the canbr br with mine i got as much air out of the bag as i could by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw i then sucked the air out until i could get no more air out then slipped the straw out whilst closing the bag in one swift motion you must do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream so be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product
2125,5,my  month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if id let him he loves these puffs he just munches on them like they are chocolate or something that one really loves i just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done hell start whining for more he does not do that with any other snack its insane i have tried them and i must confess they are good but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them i obviously buy these in bulk weve only tried the carrotcheese i think the other flavor because of the green color may confuse him but i will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack
2126,5,i purchased these for our  month old twins a while back and they absolutely loved them they are now  months and still love them they prefer them over the happymelts even though they like those as well below is my procons listbr br prosbr both babies love thembr they are overall healthy have less sodium etc than other products of the same type of snackbr a lot of munchies in each containerbr great price on amazon with subscribe  savebr br consbr they are messy as they easily crumble and there are a lot of tiny crumbles in the bottom of the containerbr this particular flavor is sort of flavorless to me however my twins seem to disagree with my taste buds
2127,5,i am a mom of  kids with my older two i had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didnt have so much sodium when my rd came along happyfamily introduced happymunchies i was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too and to top it off it is organic so i know it is free of pesticide residue and gmos
2128,5,baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option we have tried other brands gerber but this is her favorite by far and i dont feel bad giving them to her as i know that they are high quality hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well 
2129,5,ive bought them many times good quality and good taste baby love it and i love it too reccommend it
2130,2,i bought this because its organic cheese puff my son love gerber cheese lil crunchies i thought he may like this too i subscribe it once a month now there is  cans not open the idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great but there is no taste for this cheese snack there is no cheese flavor in the puff my son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me my son love happybabys yogurt melts beef stew happy baby banana beet blueberry and spinach mango and pear this cheese puff does not work for him
2131,5,while i worry that i am teaching my baby to be a snacker these are perfect for the inbetween times for my  year old grazer the label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative i like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal etc i dont think they taste awesome but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear that makes me happy
2132,5,we love these the cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor my daughter age  likes them both but because we snack on them in the car i opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too i love that they are healthy and i can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things love em
2133,5,my two boys love the happy munchies cheddar cheesecarrot they request them as their snack as they watch their show on tv i love that they are low in sodium includes mg of choline per serving which is great for their eyesand tastes great also they are kosher certified which is a plus as well i love to put these in baggies and keep them in my purse for emergency snacks on the go healthy crunchy and a must buy
2134,4,my  year old son does really like these andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks  the only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go
2135,5,these are a great alternative to chips  i wasnt sure how they would be based on other reviews but i am glad i bought them and wish i would of found them sooner  i have twin  month olds and they cant get enough of them  i like them too
2136,5,my son is only mo so he cant say it yet but he loves these  he gets excited when i even take them out of the pantry i like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots
2137,5,my son loves them and i can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so wont choke and they are good for him too
2138,3,the title of my review says it all as long as it didnt get cut off these have a lot more air in them than the gerber little crunchies these crush extremely easily and get dustcrumbs all over the place also they do not taste nearly as good as the gerber little crunchies they might be better for you and i like that it has a hint of veggies in it but my  month old isnt very happy with them shell snack on them if thats her only option and shes really hungry but she definitely will not choose them we first got these several months ago and shes had the same reaction to them every time since then
2139,5,happybaby happymunchies baked organic cheese and veggie snack cheddar cheesecarrot  ounces pack of br br hello this is six items should be installed but i only received a i with amazon contact but nobody reason i please verify as soon as possible give me reissue thank you
2140,5,i purchased this at my local health food store and i am enjoying it immensely  the juice has a nice robust texture and it is not overly salty the flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshingbr i combine it with odwalla flashpasteurized  carrot juice for a wellaboveaverage vegetable juice that is a good energybooster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juicesbr enjoy
2141,5,we love these baby food things in a little pouch sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added  just fruit for smaller ones not good to let them handle it themselves because they love to squeeze it which gets things everywhere but older ones can feed to themselves i like the  size rather than the bigger one that plum organics has for some of the other flavors it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later you can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives  not the case with the bigger pouches i also like that it is bpa free if your little one likes them ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store
2142,3,i really wanted my kids to love it these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious or so it seemed unfortunately none of the kids cared for it  it tastes like stage  baby food very bland and is very runny too so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it
2143,5,i discovered these when my daughter was about  months old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic taste great are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient i always keep some in my purse and in the car when were out and about they are not messy unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch which only happens for us when shes not hungrybr br the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for  each if you buy them in sets of  that is usually when i stock up for the next two months 
2144,5,my daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruittogo choices weve bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and i loved these the most it it not overly sweet and a strawberry variation as well tastes really good she can easily eat  of these every daybr i really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added  it is organic just fruit pureebr br i personally dont like banana variation but its just because of my own personal preferences i like fresh bananas more than cooked other than that my daughter approved all of flavors to  stars
2145,5,plum products are such a wonderful and yummy idea for the toddler heck even the adult from time to time i keep a full stock of every flavor fruit pouch plum makes for toddlers they make a great snack to throw in the diaper bag or back pack whether you are packing a for a trip to the store school lunches or going to disneyland these pouches have saved the day many many times i have even grabbed one or two to add to my lunch when no other fruit was available for me and it was really good i have and will always recommend plum to every parent i know
2146,5,i love plum organic pouch  got this one on sale  my baby and toddler love this so much  my  years old always ask me for more
2147,5,my son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips  a lot of time i cant find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son he is  can eat  these are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch  just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess
2148,5,have had other brands like this before and have always enjoyed them  these were a really good bargain on sale
2149,5,my  month old loves this  has no problem holding it  sucking the food out  this is great for on the go
2150,5,this makes feeding on the go so easy my oneyearold will suck down a pouch in  minutes and she loves them
2151,5,i bought this for my  month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late  i wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day  this does the trick  he loves them and he can feed himself  what more can i say  oh i actually tried one and they really are good
2152,5,i tried this product because it was a friday special and it caught my eye it being  fruit and  organic  i dont have any children but this looked interesting to try because ive been trying to eat healthier and sometimes its hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day  i buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before i can eat it all  i bought the banana mish mash also and really like it too  i like to add it to my oatmeal or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast or just by itself  to clarify the ingredients it has  different fruits not just peach and not just banana  obviously im ok with thisjust wanted to throw that out there  there are multiple things i love about this product  here goes and not in any particular orderbr  easy to open convenient resealable pouchbr  it tastes greatbr  all natural  fruitno nasty preservatives or chemicalsbr   organicbr  great for everyone not just babiesbr  the price is good compared with other similar products and i love the free shipping
2153,5,not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice great to throw in a diaper bag or purse spendy but definitely a good deal when its on sale
2154,5,these are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive  i love the all natural ingrediants and i actually find them to taste great  i actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too  i make  of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplementbr br my twin niece and nephew who are  months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum  i highly recommend these over any other baby food product
2155,5,this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infantit is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag now that my daughter is older she is able to feed herself with the pouch just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeezesuck the fruit out of it not only is the packaging great but the fruit tastes good as well and yes i have tasted everything that i feed my daughter my daughter loves thisher whole face lights up when i hand her a pouch
2156,3,i know these are super trendy right now and i totally wanted to love this product or to be more exact i wanted my toddler to love this product he took one taste handed it back to me and said why you gave me baby food mom i tasted it and he is right it tastes just like jarred baby food same consistency not any thicker too if your kid likes the packaging great if your kid doesnt then it is just really really expensive baby food im going to give the rest to my baby as the toddler is not the least bit interested
2157,5,well maybe im the first one to review this wonderful treat but i know im not the first one having tried them this treat is so safe healthy and yummy in my native language miammiam is for yumyumbr there you go not too sweet yet not lacking sweetness you cant taste one ingredient above the other one ok besides the coconut since its mostly made of it its so goodbr br this is a raw food product that has been dehydrated at low temps its really nice to give to our kids we have  of them and they love it of course its a bit more expensive than your average treatscandies but hey who wants to complainbr br do you want crappy candies with dyes chemicals and cooked so basically poison or you want to give real food for yourself and your kidsbr br i bet if people learn to doprepare these treats and give that to their kids school would be less filled with asperger syndromes add adhd kids etcbr br this is a treat that you wont regret having spent money on it unless of course you are so used to the chemical loadedpesticideherbicideoverly cookedhigh fructose corn syrupdyed candy then its not for youbr br keep your money instead youll need it for the bills youll have when you go to the numerous docs that cant help you and your kids sorry
2158,1,this flavor is awful we absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao  maca is really difficult to get down i give all the other flavors  stars
2159,5,delicious and nutritious we live for coconut and nut treats since we dont eat grains when i want to splurge i pick up a bag of these from whole foods or my local indie health store they average around  here unless theyre on sale  id looove to be able to buy these in bulk yum yum
2160,1,we have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year  over the past few months we have had a problem with the cases of grammys pot pie cans  some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lardlike gravy with no veggies and some cases were fine with chicken and veggiesetc what happened to truth in labeling  we also had the problem with the cans being only halffull sometimes our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them merrickbr   they need to start testing their food again  it used to be great  look at the old reviews from last year and before
2161,3,ive been feeding this wet food to my dogs for  years and as my husband has said if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food but i am a little upset with the fact that the cans arent full in this last case some were even only half full i have  dogs and this stuff isnt cheap
2162,1,please think twice about purchasing this product especially if you have a smallbreed dog i was lured by the cute gimmicky labeling and sold by the ingredient list but i twice fed merrick canned food to both of my dogs and both times both dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis  an illness which is dangerous  extremely painful to the animal and which requires hospitalization im not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high or if merrick uses an ingredientadditive that somehow sickened both of my unrelated dogs but this food made them very ill after their second hospitalization for pancreatitis i spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding merrick to their smallbreed dogs for the same reason  the food caused vomiting diarrhea and lethargy in their pets
2163,5,i am just passing along the star rating from our three miniature schnauzers this stuff is a big hit at our house we give them each an easy to digest kibble thats good for them and put a tablespoon of pot pie on top no more turned up noses now  they wolf it all down be sure to mix it up real good before serving
2164,5,i just switched from merrick whole earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by merrick and my dog loves it  this a great for dogs that like human food
2165,5,we adopted an yearold dalmatian earlier this year and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet but we couldnt pass up trying a can of this dog foodsadly just because of the name well she loves it so now its her special occasion food we mix half a can with a cup of dry xday with no nasty side effects she also likes wingaling and the napa valley offerings from this company its high in protein and works for us
2166,5,so happy we found this online for a reasonable price  my two dogs love this stuff and it doesnt upset their stomachs  plus i love that its not made in china or something  when you look at the food it looks pretty close to people food you can see real chunks of chicken and veggies  i dont want to give my dogs any manufactured stuff but also dont have the time to make our own dog food
2167,5,i give merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dogs dry kibble and the cat even gets a taste every now and then  the chicken pot pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie i can remember
2168,4,my dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening  accordingly he will not eat plain kibble  a scoop of this on his dry food a little water to make gravy and were good to go  ordering a case from amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store too  all in all a success for us
2169,5,i switched to merrick dog food several years ago  when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison  specificlly aminopterin  and was getting worse by the daybr br my dog is my life and i would have been devastated to know i had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure so i started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling i knew that it was not natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed scrap and bonemeal  no matter how the companies tried to relabel it i also though knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micronutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just homecook meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals vitamins and micronutrients not to mention the ratios of fats oils proteins that the animals need so i was searching for a company i could trustbr br i found merrick and have not turned back we have never been happier and use both grammy pot pie kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans  though since we are a small dog we use the smaller sized cans cat food sized oz the cans are ironically enough  filled with ingredients that you can read and understand you can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound foreign really is and why they used it  i found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical i also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food i could open it and recognize ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise potato or a pea carrot etc my dog loves this merrick food and has never been healthier our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at perfect levels and she is almost  her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most pleasant aspect to discuss is that she has almost no gas i dont give her much if any people food either but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion   i think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well i will not switch from merrick food  ever my only regret is that i did not start feeding my little fourlegged one merrick sooner
2170,1,i had heard this was wonderful canned food so i tried it for my very fussy schnauzer i was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when i opened the cani scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dryand she sniffed it and walked away she does seem to like the merrick bg dry food i chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner
2171,3,my little lhasa apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago so i found merricks grammys pot pie to be low glycemic and decided to try it he loves this food it has chunks of potatoes carrots and peas not to mention chicken and apples the only downside about ordering it from amazon is the delivery method the day the food was delivered a van pulled up in front of my house and left the  cases of food i had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox needless to say someone could have taken it if i hadnt seen the delivery woman drop it off im also disabled and if it hadnt been for my nextdoor neighbor being outside at the time i couldnt have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help many of the cans were also extremely dented delivering items this way is not acceptable i would have given this review  stars if it hadnt been for the delivery
2172,1,i have a special needs pet and searched for the right food  since amazon has been a five star resource i chose to have pot pie shipped many of the cans are dented  so i have to toss them or return this is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy  best to purchase at the pet store evidently
2173,5,this canned food has real chunks of chicken in it  dogs love it  looks and smells better than humanquality canned beef stew like dinty moore
2174,4,watch out for the fat g of fat per g servingbr br i guess i knew that nuts have high fat but somehow i was stuck on the  caloriesbr the flavor of these is delicious  the wasabi flavor has a hint of smokinessbr br from the packagingbr ingredients almonds vegetable oil canola safflower andor sunflower sugar modified corn starch salt soy sauce soybean wheat salt horseradish onion spice fractionated coconut oil andor palm kernel oil garlic maltodextrin yeast estract natural flavor citrict acid disodium guanylate and disodium inosinatebr from californiabr serving size g one bagbr calories   fat cal br total fat g  sat fat br sodium mgbr potassium mgbr total carb gbr dietary fiber gbr sugars gbr protein gbr calcium    iron   vitamin e   magnesium 
2175,5,now let me start by saying i did not buy this tea as a diet supplement i bought this because i tried it from a local store as i was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was overpowering like a full peppermint tea this has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea overall it is a pleasant taste that i could drink all day
2176,4,this tea is very good  i discovered it while visiting in california the moment i got home i searched local stores for it and i was not able to find it  finally i decided to see if amazon had it and they did and i bought two boxes  as long as they make it i will buy it
2177,5,the tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting the tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box the bags are flimsy but i just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries i will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection
2178,4,i love this tea it has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea i do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but i can live with that no big deal the quality of tea makes up for that
2179,4,i found this exact same stuff at the dollar store  it is pretty good  not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea but for the price it cant be beat bags are never as good as loose leaf  i use it if i want one quick cup  i steep my loose leaf tea  times so i have to have time to drink  cups  i gave this  stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store if i make myself a mug and because it is cheap i use  bags  i would have been disappointed if i had paid the original price on here for it though
2180,2,i ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month i was happy to look on amazon and find that i could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account this tea is not the same as the one that came in the black boxthe orignal tea is brown and this tea is greenthe pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different this one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same i have lost  pounds in the last  months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change i used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for  weeks now i dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss the next order i will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on i hope i can find this orginal stuff because this is not it
2181,5,not much else to say i keep a box in my desk here at work and i can enjoy a cup anytime  nice flavor and no bitterness so i can drink it straight without sugarbr br pros  flavor and valuebr br cons  it cant do my taxes for me thats really about all i can think of  lol
2182,4,i got tired of overpaying for tea at teavana so decided to try this brand of oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised it has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer i just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags you just cant beat the value of this tea
2183,5,this is a high quality oolong tea and i cant go back to bigelow thats for sure the taste is great it is said to have slimming benefits and the tea bags are a higher quality that dont come apart easily
2184,5,i got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo so i chucked them in a ziplock when i got home  mos later i opened it and had some today i am online trying to find more
2185,3,so far nothing extremely impressive the taste to be honest isnt anything special ive had much better and for the price you get what you pay for a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived much faster than i expected by like  days so i suppose thats a plus all in all if youre looking for something extravagant keep looking as for the benefits havent really noticed anything new but ill keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes then update my review till then yeah maybe i should i invested in something else but since it was barely any money i guess i didnt do too bad
2186,2,just got my teabags today and the first bag i made tea with the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping  the bag remained intact though the second bag while unwrapping the teabag the tag ripped the bag right openbr br the tea tasted fine not very strong like most other oolong teas  the quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material  two out of two broke i guess i need to be more careful with the others
2187,5,you just cant beat the taste of the original dubble bubble gumballs it really doesnt matter that the taste only last a minute or so but that is why i bought the tub the  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in a condition if your longing for the classic taste go for it you will not be dissappointed
2188,2,holy cow  i have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this  also it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs  use it in your garden dont eat it
2189,4,using the entire sauce packet is over kill leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton otherwise noodles are well made and sauce is reasonably well flavored quick and easy a no brainer
2190,1,i had high hopes for this product when i first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing  the food was easy to prepare at my workplace  however to me the taste was very oily and flavorless  im a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor
2191,4,this is pretty good stuff you cant expect a whole lot from instant boxonoodles but this is the best out of all the other brands ive tried before the noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well im going to buy more
2192,4,it tastes better than it looks was the first thing i said the a skeptical coworker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave  unfortunately its as fattening as it looks so i likely wont be purchasing it often  i could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though
2193,4,while its not traditional satay  it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine i will buy again
2194,1,i love peanut satay  this product is truly terrible  in no way does it resemble that dish  oily salty and tastes lousy  dont waste your money on this brand
2195,4,i adore this brand of peanut satay noodles  unlike the other ethnicfoodsinbox kames noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious  however theres certainly a downside  this dish is greasy fattening and high in calories  if you read the nutritional information youll find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very fillingbr br my advice  split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice  the sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it bleeds into the rice  an instant and tasty multidish meal
2196,3,this is not real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad i like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that i dont have time to go out to lunch these are really easy to make just mix together the cooked noodles and the bag of sauce and microwave for about  minutes you will not get a restaurant quality meal out of this but it is decent for just over  a box the box says it is  servings but if you are not mixing in any meat or anything it really is only  serving
2197,4,a nearby fresh and easy neighborhood market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and i enjoy trying them one is a variety of baxters soups from canada today i had the butternut squash and red pepper soup quite good smooth and mellow mild taste but delicious goes down real easy and it only comes to  calories per serving  servings per can alas the sodium content is a bit higher than i like otherwise very goodbr br gary peterson
2198,5,i have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place bristol farms had closed  i love it especially in my salad dressings
2199,5,the pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition  i encountered this as an ingredient in a mollie katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint  we thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue and got many rave reviews from our guests vegetarian and nonvegetarian alike  i recommend both the vendor and this item
2200,5,fast professional transaction  i needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great  now i just need to find more uses for this stuff
2201,4,only pommolive ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish it seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the chef used was a brighter red color
2202,5,i have two recipes im anxious to try that call for pomegranate molasses ive called all the specialty and best markets in the sacramento area and no ones heard of this much less carries it  its common in mediterranean recipes goes with shrimp fish chicken beef and pork i was delighted to find it on amazon and look forward to using mine in a fabulous short ribs recipe  im also passing along the info to my friends so they can order their own  or i may give as gifts to my gourmet cook friends
2203,5,i would recommend this product  i received it in a timely manner and the price was good
2204,5,pomegranate molasses is my mothers secret recipe for great meatballs she adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incrediblebr br once i setup my own household she gave me a present  pomegranate molasses of my own i learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces it has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time it has deep red color and looks very appealingbr br it keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator it blends well with walnuts adds a unique flavor to beans adds wonderful flavor to poultry gives a nice taste to fish gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables and is a great tenderizer for lamb and porkbr br i like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor and beautiful color to sorbetsbr br ali julia review
2205,5,so i bought this pomegranate molasses to make fattoush the delicious middle eastern salad of greens cukes tomatoes and torn up bits of fried leftover pita bread  wowee fattoush is now my favorite salad ive eaten so often lately that the tart lemony dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw youch i tend to do that find a food i really like then eat it so much i almost make myself sick on itbr br anyways the fattoush salad dressing with its complex blend of sumac olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses  i was lucky enough to find it at a russian grocery store yay  but the store is far away and so i had to look around online to buy more thank god for amazonbr br now granted my bottle will likely last years if all i do with it is make fattoush one goopy half teaspon at a time so ive used it in a few other things  i added a teaspoon to a lemon chicken marinade a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt had to add honey too cuz it was sour  a tiny amount added to christmas salmon cream cheese log i used it in fesenjen a persian stew of chicken and walnuts i used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue everbr br just dont do what i did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses what a horrible mess the cookies looked normal slightly lighter than normal but the smell  and the taste  ewwww
2206,5,always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip  this brand of tahini id never tried before or seen in supermarkets so i decided to order and try itexcellent by itself or in recipes highly recommended
2207,4,this was a very good puchase the shipper was very fast and very friendly the tahini was very fresh and of good quality i will order again
2208,5,we love to make hummus and love to make sandwitches salad dressings one of our kids favorite foods is tahini over cold undon noodles
2209,5,having lived in the middle east for  years our family loves hummos and we make a lot of it  this is the best brand ive ever found in the us  i like the taste and the texture of this one and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients  i found it somewhere locally then when i went to buy more i couldnt find it again  krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini  i was delighted to find it on amazon
2210,5,i have never used tahini before  and my hummus was good but always something was missing after i found out of tahini i ordered it and it was shipped extremelly fastand used it the result was amazing one spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag lb beans and i had my favorite ready to go
2211,2,very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected very runny actually there are better brands out there
2212,4,we purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born  they make a very nice announcement of the new arrival  they are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum
2213,2,hibr br my first grandson was born and i wanted everything under the sun to celebrate  this is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time  howevereverything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just werent fresh  these little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock  the moral of the story is that being a fun item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselvesat least they could have been fresh and not hard
2214,1,i purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson  i should have opted for real cigars they might have tasted better these cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet
2215,1,ordered some from an amazonfulfilled associate normal amazon shipping etcthe cigars were cracked and stale how does chewing gum shatter and break no way it was fit for consumptionbr easy return process
2216,5,this product arrived in a timely manner in good condition and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived
2217,5,when our third child and first son was born we sent our oldest to school kindergarten with these for her friends to celebrate it really made her feel important at school and helped her celebrate the birth of our little boy she loved doing it and her friends enjoyed them too btw teachers we did clear it with the teachers at school first so no hate mail please
2218,5,i have nothing but good service ever since i started ordering from amazoncom  keep up the good work
2219,5,there is much confusion about tomatoes and shopping online in this case adds to the complexity  these are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing  the strianese are hands down the best  my local store sells them  i have been using them for fifteen years  but they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is brutal  no prime shipping with them  i use these specific cento when i am not home  it all depends on how much your sauce means to youbr br but you need to know what you are buying  these cento tomatoes are  san marzano sauce tomatoes  they are dop certified  and this point is often overlooked they are from the sarnese nocerino  they are the second best in terms of absolute flavor  bright from proper acid deep from proper natural saltsugar balance  you probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower or do it yourself and have no day job  cento sells many others much cheaper that are not thesebr br the price per can is good  the best deal is if you have amazon prime and get regular shipments  i get three large batches per case enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce daybr br most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz fresh tomatoes at the supermarket  but if you are a maestro these are what you want
2220,1,ive had a lot of san marzano tomatoes in my day both fresh and canned and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet i opened the first can from this order and the tomatoes werent very good at all  nothing like i was used to i later noticed that the can does not have the dop certified label like the photo on the amazon page does these tomatoes are not dop certified and are not real san marzano tomatoes they are a cheap imitation  the seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price i would recommend you stay away from these  you can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store
2221,1,the label is misleading cento actually sells two kind of san marzano with the same label other than one that says dop certified you will receive the one wo the dop if you order from amazon i have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing cento sells ones are dop and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late the true dop ones i have to say make the best sauce you can taste the difference
2222,1,buyer beware the label on the amazon site clearly states dop certified but the product received does not match the site label and does not state dop certified this is bait and switch and i will file a complaint with amazon
2223,5,dop san marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet but i can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store is this unusual boston is pretty heavily italian in some areas maybe that makes a difference i dont understand why anyone would buy them at this price check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price
2224,2,you order and pay fordop certified san marzano tomatoes but you will receive certified which means absolutely nothing a true sm tomato will have an eu dop emblem on the label plus the corsorzio san marzano stamp this is false advertising  if you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps you will not receive this dop label  you will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the cento name typical marketing hoodwinking amazon refuses to take returns on this item so beware
2225,1,since a dop product is not readily available at my local grocery stores i got really excited when i saw the photo of this product at the amazon website because the photo states that this product is dop certifiedbr br but when i received the shipment it was a huge disappointment  it was a different product than what the photo promised  i can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily  very disappointing
2226,1,ive used cento san marzano dop certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoesbr that said this is the st time ive ordered this item from amazon and all  cans arrived completely dented and banged upbr terrible presentation for an expensive itembr as an aside none of the cans i received has a dop certified label but only certified and no serial  on the side of the cans so im not sure if these tomatoes are actually dop certified or not
2227,3,the amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product  the picture claims dop certified  neither appears to be true  the cans i received were just certified and it didnt say by who  there is no usda organic label either  i also knew all these things before i bought them since they are well documented in the amazon reviews already so i wasnt surprised by what i receivedbr br on the plus side they are better tomatoes than i can buy canned in the grocery stores locally so im happy enough with them and i used reward points from my amazoncom visa to buy them so they were essentially free to mebr br would i buy them again  maybe  if couldnt get any of the strianese dop certified san marzano tomatoes then yes i probably would  as i said they are tasty and i do like them better than what i can buy locally but they arent the top tomato when it comes to what i can mail order
2228,4,i discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes they are worth paying for unfortunately in my area they are approaching  bucks a can and never go on sale walmart has them for about  dollars a can but i prefer not to be tied down to that store the local italian mart advertised san marzano tomatoes  cans for  dollars too good to  be true yes in fact  these are very ordinary tomatoes i am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good pricethey turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience
2229,1,the can that is shown says dop certified but when my relative ordered them from amazoncom the cans that were shipped only indicate certified one can buy these nondop at any walmart what do they mean by certified certified as to whatbr br unfortunately the venders are making fools of amazoncom as a consequence i am staying away from cento products entirely fool me and amazon once shame on cento fool me and amazon twice shame on me and amazon there is no way i can make this review fun
2230,4,i received my order with a few problems the majority of the cans arrived dented some very severely amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box i am surprised they havent fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews however amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food itemsthey are shipping me a new order no charge and i get to keep my original order i am hoping my new order arrives in better condition these san marzano tomatoes are not dop certified even though the description says they are many people have complained about this in the reviews so i am surprised amazon is still listing them as dop certified however they are very good quality tomatoes and certified organic i have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so heres a tipplace it in your shopping cart and then save it for later check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop i paid  but i have seen the price as high as  so it pays to be patient good luck
2231,1,these are not dop theyre just certified which means nothing significant they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write department certified real dop tomatoes are much better
2232,5,purchased a small case of these tomatoes i used them for pizza sauce and they tasted great the labels looked identical to the picture posted on amazon
2233,5,i love san marzano tomatoes and centos are great they have the greatest sweetest taste ever worth ever penny and than some
2234,1,they tomatoes are certified san marzano but not dop like the item shows in picture i called amazon and they sent me another box of  for free to fix issue the new shipment was still certified not dop  so please know this tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi
2235,2,i purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener wont open them  i complained to amazon and they shipped another case out right away  but those cans are worse than the first case  i wont order again
2236,1,the product image is misleading the image has the tomatoes as dop certified but the tomatoes i received are not
2237,5,these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipesfull flavor not too acidic and very italian  always the best choice for italian cooking
2238,4,most if not all of the cans were dented in some way however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product
2239,5,this is a fine product  why sure its has a flavor that on other tomato has an earthy taste
2240,1,merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise   of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not dop certified  they sent me lower standard merchandise  received full refund from amazzon
2241,4,i have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product i had a previous shipment where all was well but not this time the shipment came in a badly mangled box but i thought all would be well when the interior box was pristine i was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an undamaged box this tells me that the can was already dented when packed amazon should reconsider their source for this productthe tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks
2242,5,the product is great  but it is priced nearly twice what it retails for in local markets i dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery but this is too much
2243,3,received different than pictured labels just say certified not dop certified dont know if that is the same and after a couple of orders i am not going to put the effort in to find outbr also came with basil i want tomatoes only not basilbr a couple cans dented like others have saidbr my case was  now its br im over the tomato thing ill buy what i want in the store
2244,1,of the  cans shipped  of them had very very serious dents in them im not talking dings i talking serious dents  so dented that i truly thought of throwing them away  my husband stopped me though because at  a can he felt that it was too wasteful  in my local grocery store items this dented are put into a reduced price bin because they usually dont move otherwisea hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbchzcento san marzano certified tomatoes ounce cans pack of a
2245,5,this product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price  overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce  to squism  i find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife even if you are joking this is not the place for that sort of behavior  if you really hit your wife your a punk coward  domestic abuse is not a laughing matter and i was personally offended by your review  try to maintain some amount of class when posting on here  i am sure that is something you are incapable of doing judging by your disgusting and classless review
2246,1,its a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies im very disappointed when i noticed that the same kind sold in china is even better
2247,1,do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrupbr i used this until i realized that i switched to gerber its so much better for your baby
2248,3,if your child is truly lactose intolerant this product is great  if fussinessgas is an issue then consider staying with similac advance or another formula that is made primarily with milk  this product did seem to create less fussiness in our baby but honestly i think the dr brown bottles made a bigger impact  make your own tradeoff between fussiness vs nutrition just be aware of which formulas are made with corn sweeteners and which are truly milkbasedbr br its misleading for the company to label the product as milkbased when it has minor ingredients derived from milk  read the list of ingredients below  i found the ingredients on the parent companys website abbott nutrition  dont try to find the ingredients list on the simlac website  its not there perhaps for good reasonbr br similac sensitive ingredientsbr corn maltodextrin sugar sucrose milk protein isolate high oleic safflower oil soy oil coconut oil galactooligosaccharides less than  of the following c cohnii oil m alpina oil betacarotene lutein lycopene calcium phosphate potassium citrate modified corn starch potassium chloride magnesium chloride monoglycerides soy lecithin carrageenan calcium carbonate ascorbic acid choline chloride sodium chloride ferrous sulfate choline bitartrate taurine minositol dlalphatocopheryl acetate zinc sulfate lcarnitine niacinamide calcium pantothenate cupric sulfate thiamine chloride hydrochloride vitamin a palmitate riboflavin pyridoxine hydrochloride folic acid manganese sulfate potassium iodide phylloquinone biotin sodium selenate vitamin d cyanocobalamin potassium hydroxide and nucleotides adenosine monophosphate cytidine monophosphate disodium guanosine monophosphate disodium uridine monophosphatebr  sourced from milk gosbr  a source of docosahexaenoic acid dhabr  a source of arachidonic acid arabr br similac advance ingredientsbr nonfat milk lactose high oleic safflower oil soy oil coconut oil galactooligosaccharides whey protein concentrate less than  of the following c cohnii oil m alpina oil betacarotene lutein lycopene ascorbic acid calcium carbonate potassium citrate soy lecithin monoglycerides potassium chloride carageenan magnesium chloride ferrous sulfate choline bitartrate choline chloride taurine calcium phosphate potassium phosphate minositol zinc sulfate niacinamide dalphatocopheryl acetate calcium pantothenate lcarnitine riboflavin vitamin a palmitate cupric sulfate thiamine chloride hydrochloride pyridoxine hydrochloride folic acid manganese sulfate phylloquinone biotin sodium selenate vitamin d cyanocobalamin sodium chloride potassium hydroxide and nucleotides adenosine monophosphate cytidine monophosphate disodium guanosine monophosphate disodium uridine monophosphatebr  sourced from milk gosbr  a source of docosahexaenoic acid dhabr  a source of arachidonic acid arabr guanosine monophosphate disodium uridine monophosphatebr  sourced from milk gosbr  a source of docosahexaenoic acid dhabr  a source of arachidonic acid ara
2249,5,this formula is a lifesaver  our month old had a little viral bug which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy  with this formula he barely spits up at all and has been so much happierbr br ask your doctor for a sample  when we took our baby in for his tummy troubles the doc gave us a fullsized can of this formula to take home and try  considering it costs about  retail this was greatbr br prosbr reduced spitup and gasbr reduced fussinessbr easy to mix upbr br consbr baby cant go as long between feedings probably because its easier to digestbr br you can also get  free cans of similac one advance and one sensitive by mail if you register at their website  great product and great customer service
2250,1,i decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy however this formula made him more gassythe formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby i tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didnt work
2251,5,good price for product i had started my baby on the similac soy formula but it was too much for my sons tummy this formula was a welcomed change unfortunately it came at the funky time of similacs big recall of all the larger containers i was buying the oz can from the wholesale store and the smaller containers were all sold out of the local stores not a fun situation finding this pack at a reasonable price was a much needed and appreciated rescue
2252,2,if your newborn cries inconsolably you should try a lactosefree formula right away even though theyre so expensive however the ingredients may not look so good  its important to shop around if youre going to use a lactosefree formula lactosefree formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solidsbr br from wikipedia baby colic also known as infant colic threemonth colic infantile colic and colic is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason youll know it if it happens to your baby and its awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby  it contains dha ara and iron but all baby formulas do because it is required by lawbr br lactosefree formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process im told by the companys public relations representative  so much food in the us is prepared with corn syrup solids so that shouldnt be a worry im told  ok but i notice the obesity rate is high
2253,5,great formula our son is not getting stomach pains like with the regular similac and he actually likes the taste  the only thing is that its way cheaper at costco  per oz  tax amazon is not willing to price match
2254,3,we just changed to gerber good start gentle due to sugar in this product  this did seem to work better than a couple other formula but i decided to try something else when i read about sugar  we just changed over to gerber good start gentle and it does so far seem to be working better  he is still gassy but he has less pain and doesnt seem in nearly as much discomfort when eating he is a little colic but still loves to eat  i do this this is a good product and im sure the sugar is safe i just would rather not give extra sugar at this age  weeks  good luck
2255,5,while i have not purchased this from amazon i have used it for many years  it makes a super layer for my version of zuppa engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for pate chouxbr i dont live in hollywood any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to amazon i find it it available and in larger cans  i plan to order soonbr br gino rossibr mangia con passione chefcaterer
2256,1,the description of this product is disceptive  this product was represented as a powder but it is not a powder its a granule  it is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesnt even dissolve in a high speed commercial blenderbr br unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolatecoated coconut patty to me it is useless  my intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake  it ended up ruining the shake as i had to resort to chewing the undissolved tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shakebr br additionally the way the product was packaged there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was openedbr br if i could have rated this product zero stars i would have the only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive  i gave one package away for free to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible
2257,1,i bought this same brand from an online indian grocery store that usually has excellent products  i was able to turn it into creambutter using my super blender and adding some water but it barely had any flavor  i usually buy the chao kah brand of coconut cream which is quite tasty and flavorful and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream  my complaint is not the shreds or texture  mine was just virtually tasteless
2258,4,although i had some concerns about product with initial shipment  my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns  customer service that seems a rarity these days  was absolutely exceptional  will definitely keep this vendor in mind when i have need for other craft suppliesproducts
2259,2,i bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenserbr br  its made of cheap plastic and arrived w the globe scratched and crackedbr br  the top doesnt screw onit just pops off w very little exertionbr br  part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coinoperated  what the description on amazon doesnt tell you however is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy  furthermore when the crank is just barely turned the candy usually two pieces flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor wo your hand there to catch it  a young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candybr br  the dispenser only came w enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globebr br  it is very much overpriced at 
2260,4,the mm candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy it does intimidate a mm lover because of the small amount it dispenses
2261,1,i was disappointed when i received this dispenser  it said a large dispenser  it looks like something for a child to play with  i bought it for my husband to put in his man cave  he is a huge mm fan  i buy him a tree ornament each year from the mm collections  i was hoping it had more substance to it  i also did not realize i was unable to return this item
2262,4,im on my first jar of this and am really enjoying what it adds to my concoctions  vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions garlic vegetables usually tofu rice or pasta or quinoa sometimes olives or capersbr i may have purchased it at uwajimaya when on salei will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste  its not really a paste  more liquid with easily identifiable basil leaves  i highly recommend this chili paste
2263,5,this deal on amazon with the prime free shipping andor the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do  one of our favorites is layered graham crackers this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting  lots of stores are discontinuing name brands so this is a great item to buy here
2264,4,my husband loves pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner this is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat i love that i can add whatever i want to it to fancy it up a little i love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids
2265,5,like always this label is the best in desserts and this  ounce vanilla pudding is not the exeption is easy to make and vey fast and the size is the best for a little families the vanilla flavor is fantastic
2266,5,you can substitute nut milk coconut milk or goats milk or even soy milk for the milk in this instant puddingbr br if you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding if you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding you can add some softened cream cheese and have cheese cake base puddin you are only limited by your imagination this is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix about a  packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid
2267,4,i always enjoy jello pudding however one package that i recieved was opened and the powder spilled all over  it really alters the price when you only recieve  packages instead of the promised 
2268,5,my big boy oreo loves this so much i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit turkey he cant get enough of this stuff
2269,5,delivered by ups this product is just about perfect  it does not have a disagreeable smell and the dogs love it  it is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it  you can even see an occasional pea andor carrot no grain to worry about
2270,5,i have two terrier mixes and they love this product i mix it with their dry grain free dog food and they just gobble it up like no tomorrow i am happy that amazon has this product on subscribe and save its one less thing to worry about since i know its going to arrive every two monthsbr br when i know im going to be out of the house for a long time i take this product and smear it inside a kong toy oh em gee talk about keeping these add pups occupied for a period of time br br like the other buyer said you occassionally see a piece of carrot or potato here and there  i like looking at the ingredients on this product theres no added water mechanically separated meat or other by product good job
2271,5,bought  lb each of five different mos fudge recently from a school fundraiser im not much of a chocolate fudge eater prefer peanut butter but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible so rich and creamy almost too creamy had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut but if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover this can
2272,5,this mild semisoftsoft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that i have yet to find elsewhere  the price is worth it though i cant afford to order it often but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight
2273,5,this tea is absolutely incredible addicted after first taste so delicious the smell the taste its a beautiful experience i just ordered more and gonna try both regular and decaf
2274,5,i love this tea and drink it at least twice a day  the flavor is both strong and sweet  the tea stands on its own never needing sweetner  if youre a cinnamon lover you have to try this tea  and even if youre not its worth a try
2275,5,i am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by caribou coffee  i think i could be considered an addict the flavor is so good  lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it  price for  is good and less than i have been able to find it elsewhere
2276,5,after having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition i tried many different kinds and favors of tea until i stumbled  upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby i loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years the sachets are perfect for a larger mug the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or mugs its a hearty tea that i find satisfying and delicious
2277,5,as a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor i find this tea amazing  i was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that  i can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but i will continue to drink it probably every day  enjoy
2278,5,love this tea its like drinking liquid red hots  i hate herbal teas bc they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome 
2279,5,a coworker gave me a couple of the harney  sons fine teas hot cinnamon spice sachets to sample the cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful these teas are not available at my local grocery stores i was glad to find them for a reasonable price online
2280,5,i love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste  its equally good as an iced tea  full marks
2281,5,i drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites the scent is enticing and the flavor is bold and sweet at the same time  if you love spice this is a must have tea
2282,5,super tasty super delicious best tea ever sweet and cinnamony i actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags
2283,5,this is an excellent tea very flavorful  the cinnamon is fresh and powerful and overall its slightly sweet without needing any sugar excellent with milk or straight
2284,5,this is more than just a tea drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience it has a multidimensional flavor it really does i never considered myself a tea drinker but i ordered it once at a starbucks and was hooked ever since on special occasions or even when i am down i treat myself to a cup of this warm and delicous tea
2285,5,its that good  heaven if you like cinnamon  tastes sweet with no sugar
2286,5,i was actually surprised at how good these muffins taste i have reordered a case  and they are gluten free
2287,3,traditional english muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat  this little challenger should be called something else all togetherbr br closer to what i would say a croissant is having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with itbr br terrific if thats what you are looking for in an english muffin but not what im looking for  i would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert
2288,5,had this sent to me in afghanistan the flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy it is made with quailty ingridents i would surely say this is one of the best salsas ive ever had
2289,5,i love vitamuffins but my supermarket sells one box of  muffins for   instead i bought the mix  boxes for  and each box makes  muffins instead of  per muffin the mix only requires water  eggs and works out to about  cents per muffin and very easy to make thats a great deal
2290,5,i buy these through the shipandsave program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routinebr light flavorful and full of vitamins these only take  minutes to bake with minimal extras i am vegan so i use egg substitutes   tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with  tbs water and they still bake perfectly
2291,3,i really like the frozen corn muffin tops but the mix resulted in a dryer product i used the paper muffin liners and i think these might have added to the dryness
2292,2,i found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing if i cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt it was ok would not order this flavor again
2293,5,better then i expected i notice there was some complaints that the muffins were drybr so i sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oilsame as pam butter spraybr this did the trick they were great
2294,4,i generally like vitalicious products the corn muffin well for  calories its not bad but if you are expecting anything like the sugarfat laden junk that your local bakery sells look elsewhere this is like a healthy makeover that doesnt quite cut it but theyre not bad for the same amount of calories the chocolate one is more of an indulgence but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat especially baked freshbr my kids are happy to get any extra snacks so they approvei send with them to school for a midmorning snack im glad they get fuel and vitamins
2295,1,the picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but i was only sent one but was charged for three also the item sent was not the item shown i can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store i went to amazon because i was looking for the type shownbr br when i contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping seeing as how i was shipped something i didnt order i should be entitled to a full refund including shipping i was not offered thatbr br if i could give this seller negative stars i would any future buyers beware
2296,2,too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest
2297,5,i like loose tea i just dont like chewing on leaves in my tea cup or having to dispose of a bunch of loose soggy leaves that seem to find every corner of my kitchen however im spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea so ive been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea most bags of this type ive encountered are made in europe and come with a price to match and a single pack of  doesnt last a whole long time  when i saw this deal here on amazon i went for itbr br the bags look and work identically to the european made ones although i believe these are made in india where they know a whole lot about making tea but the price is about  less than that of the european made ones i cant argue with that well i could argue with that but im not a dope that way we can have the best tea on the market which is sold loose without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer just throw in the right amount of tea tuck the top flap into the bag and thats it you now have a teabag of your favorite kenyan black tea or whatever makes you happy throw away the neat little soggy bag when youre done  no mess at allbr br ive decided to get these on as a subscription with a  pack arriving twice a year that way my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day this size works for both and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out weve been using these bags for several months now and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived if amazon keeps offering these bags i am sure well keep buying them
2298,3,the tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value but what youre not told is that the bags are the large size better made for large pots and not single cups
2299,5,i like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders  these bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden
2300,1,was shocked at the skinny size of this item they are five inches long as i expected because thats the size i wanted and ordered but cant be any bigger around than even a pencil and thats a big stretch wow im sure disappointed considering the cost   and shipping wont be ordering these againbr   of course my dog likes them ok but wouldnt call them her fav by any means   will i send them back dont know if its worth the hassle at this point but i will not recommend them either because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from  keep looking is my advice br   the other beefeaters products i ordered well met my standards this one was a dud  whats the old saying  buyer beware  i fell into that trap big timebr   heres the product link at this timebr br   a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbaidubeefeaters great fillin porkhide rolls with meaty chicken filling inchabr br   wish you luck if you try this productbut again buyer bewarebr br update  my little dog got very sick not too long after i wrote this reviewi contacted cust service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money hows that for customer care  great thank you amazoncom  you are terrific
2301,5,my scottish terrier inhaled hers in about  hours but my finicky pomeranian who usually turns his nose up at chew toys loved it it kept my pom busy for a few weeks but he really enjoyed itbr br affordable price fast shopping great product
2302,5,i love this frosting  its sugar free and i cannot find it in stores  i will be ordering more in the future
2303,5,awesome little snack treat for your favorite pupdog  my two pekeingese just love these  you can use them for training as well as just a treat  they come in a variety of flavors  my pups like the liver the best  for senior dogs these are perfect if they dont have the jaw power or teeth use anymore  they are easy to carry so you can treat your dog whenever you want to for example on a walk around the neighborhood  they are just  calories each so you dont have to worry about their weight  absolutely recommend these to every dog owner
2304,5,these are a hit with my pups and for the price and  calories a piece they cant be beat  theyre great for training in addition to putting them into food puzzle toys to keep them occupied  i also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail clipping as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary clipper at his toesbr br first ingredient is wheat flour so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these wont work for you  my dogs arent allergic nor do these treats give tummy problems so im happy  ingredient list is short thats another plus its not a long list of artificial this and thatbr br i give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheeseegg flavor to mix things up a bit  the cheeseegg ones even smell like cheese yum
2305,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbzbfall natural dog treats by charlee bear  cheese  egg   oz resealable baga these are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs at only  calories per treat even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too especially in a multidog household where one dog is overweight others are not taste must be wonderful since there isnt anything my dogs wont do for these tiny treats so im very pleased with them for many reasons great products
2306,5,my dogs breeder sent home a baggie of cheese and egg flavored charlie bears for my maltese puppy  i used them to reward him from the getgo and he will do just about anything if he knows this treat is coming  a great training aid  they are also small enough to give often and are made with good ingredients  i carry them in my pocket and my little guy keeps an eye on that pocket
2307,5,i love these treats for my two german shepherds i think these treats are great for even large size dogs my dogs absolutely go crazy for them and they are only  calories per treat perfect for training sessions i also love the texture of them you can put them in your pocket without a ton of flaking or gross smell this product also has a simplified ingredient list opposed to so many other dog treats out there you can pronounce all the ingredients in the list and you know what they are getting
2308,5,charlee bears are small and low calorie so you can use them en masse for training  we use them both for standard training sit stay drop it leave it and behavioral training no bark  theyre not stinky or messy so you can put them in your pocket purse or car without worry  we keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesnt bark at people walking by one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travelbr br the one downside to these is that because theyre not as stinky it can be harder to use them to get your dogs attention if he or she is distracted like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors  our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these and theyll take on some of the scent we use a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdgrsyprotreat beef liver freeze dried dog treats  ounceabr br our dog loves all flavors
2309,2,the treats were okmy main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaverwhich made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treatone treat just di not do itthis package should be labeled for toy or small dogs
2310,2,too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest
2311,5,i am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races  this works better than ibuprofen and is all natural  after each long run i take a couple tablespoons with my gatorade and my muscles recover quicker i experimented with not taking it  i love this stuff
2312,5,juice consentrate is very good i like it as much as the tart is smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save this will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on
2313,4,i have read a couple of the studies on the antiinflammatory potential of tart cherry juice and became convinced that its worth a try as a yo athlete  i like this product bc the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to so i can make an informed choices as to how much i use based on the numberofcherry equivalents in the studies ive read  i cant vouch for the accuracy of the label but ive no reason to doubt it  ive grown to like the flavor especially mixed with lime seltzer
2314,5,i am training for a half marathon  at the start of my training i wasnt taking cherry juice  as i increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore  i started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then i have felt pretty good  i take the juice every morning with my breakfast  it has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice  the half marathon im running in is this weekend and i feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain  this stuff works for me
2315,5,i have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck  i started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery  because my doctor has put me on a longterm antiinflammatory medication i am not allowed to take overthecounter medications like advil and tylenol  i can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same painkilling effect as taking two advil  i enjoy two glasses a day  one in the morning and one at dinner  the only downside is the sugar which is really the only processed sugar i eat during the day  the juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasantbr br i usually dont go for miracle foods or diet fads but this juice simply works  this is the real deal  it will not cure pain but it will inhibit inflammation and facilitate faster healing of arthritis spasms and sprains
2316,5,this juice is actually concentrated as advertised of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried this one is the most concentrated and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin i guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general but montmorency rtcj has the more tart best flavor
2317,4,tastes like drinking a cherry pie i purchased this for my mothers gout and she told me it works quickly its also supposed to help lower blood pressure speedy delivery its not  stars because of the high price
2318,5,every bit as good as any other brand ive tried fantastic taste and easy to use this stuff can become addictive
2319,5,i am a longdistance runner and a belly dancer  my back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running  i was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone  i read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine and i decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on amazonbr br i am simply blown away by the difference  my body really reacts to this stuff  my knee pain has disappeared and my back only hurts during really deep back bends  i had sameday relief too  i can definitely tell the difference on days where i forget to take this  as an added bonus i have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are as well  i wish i had heard about this soonerbr br i follow what it says on the bottle  once twice daily  at first i was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon tbs oz which i still do in the mornings but good lord this stuff is tart  the first one isnt too bad i think mostly because your taste buds are in shock  the second one really gets me though  lately ive been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner which looks disgusting but tastes surprisingly really goodbr br i really hope this product comes back in stock soon i dont think i could go without it and im hesitant to switch to a different brand
2320,4,good and reasonable for drink a product that is good for sleeping and inflamation i will buy again if the price stays reasonable
2321,5,this cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry   a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbjkwgicountry spoon montmorency red tart cherry juice concentrate  oza i like this product and perhaps i will order this cherry juice concentrate again
2322,4,this is very good but i prefer the liquid cherry juice  less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesnt seem to go as far as the liquid juice  just my preference
2323,2,i bought  bottles of this tart cherry juice because they were cheaper than tart is smart they may be providing the anti oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night i returned  bottle to amazon  went back to tart is smart i used to wake up  times a night  have trouble getting back to sleep being nearly   retired i can sleep in if i choose with my tis formula i get to sleep fairly quick wake up  hours later  get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom this product may work much better for you but i found one that works for me  will stick with it forever i hope to read your opinion of this product soon
2324,2,too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest
2325,5,i have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out i love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container this makes them great to carry in my purse take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc also love that they are not overly salted like so many american brand crackers company that shipped them did a great job  fast too
2326,5,this is the best tasting cracker ive ever tasted  it may cost less in a filipino or asian store  which is all well and good unless you dont live close to one i dont  note that the box says  pound  ounces  but the description on this page says z whatever a z is  if they meant oz its incorrect  its a oz box  in any case i was able to find it even cheaper online than the price shown on this page  where  amazon grin  whenever you buy stuff like this be sure to consider the bottom line price product plus shipping  and check for alternative amazon pages where its cheaper  on this page its  for a oz box with free shipping if you total order is  or more  but on this pagebr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdxvysky flakes crackers xgabr br the same oz box costs only    shipping  or  total over a dollar cheaper than on this page  so buy from amazon  but not from this page
2327,5,this product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods
2328,5,if you like sweetarts and you want them in a bulk amount this product is for you the sweetarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition there are no downsides
2329,4,sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy  while its a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste  you really cant go wrong with this candy  the only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it youve eaten an entire roll
2330,5,i have ordered these a couple times now they arrive super fresh and sealed every time i used to buy a roll a day from the gas station now i have a stash at home that is available anytime yumm
2331,5,ive purchased bulk candies where they are old terrible flavors or simply smashed to dust this was a great buy having none of those drawbacks
2332,5,i used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out  they are great the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous way better than purchasing elsewhere  the item came as described and was fresh  thank you amazoncom
2333,5,it is very very good sweetsbr amazon always is excellentbr amazon always is excellentbr amazon always is excellentbr amazon always is excellent
2334,5,excellent shipment and product as well  looking forward to purchase again  thanksbr excellent shipment and product as well  looking forward to purchase again  thanksbr excellent shipment and product as well  looking forward to purchase again  thanks
2335,5,my family has been in love with bacis ever since we lived in europe  when my daughters were small they coined the term baci pill for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well  they are a wonderful treat after a meal with espresso or cappuccino  pop the entire baci in your mouth and experience the famous perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center  the italians do everything with class and this beats a hersheys kiss any day
2336,2,i ordered this item in a large quanity but wanted the items packaged as shown  they were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees  when they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose  if i had know they would come like this i would have gone to costo or some other discount store for the purchase  the cute little box that would have helped make them special and what i thought i paid for was missing
2337,5,my family has been in love with bacis ever since we lived in europe  when my daughters were small they coined the term baci pill for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well  they are a wonderful treat after a meal with espresso or cappuccino  pop the entire baci in your mouth and experience the famous perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center  the italians do everything with class and this beats a hersheys kiss any day
2338,5,just returned from italy and was told these little chocolates were the favs of the italiansperfect little twochocolates for gifts  and gloomy days  or happy days 
2339,5,delicious candybr outstanding price for such a rich productbr the fortunes on the inside are an added bonusbr great options relating to packaging
2340,4,my dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy she specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula unfortunately my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy i tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better ive heard numerous good things about wellness from my dog trainer as well as other pet owners and pet store employees my dog is adjusting to the new food well however i can tell he doesnt consider it the most tasty of choices probably because it doesnt have the artificial flavoring in it but id rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste
2341,5,i got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn wheat potatoes flax fish and pork  i had the hardest time finding a food that he wasnt allergic to  im so glad i found this food  he is finally eating and starting to put on some weight  it is a little pricey but i think it is worth it for such a good product
2342,5,instead of simple solution lamb  rice i was sent simple lamb  oatmeal but my dog likes it next time i will make sure i am sent the right food i didnt know until i had open and put the food in my lb container
2343,4,if your dog eats slowly  actually chews his food then this food is fantastic  we have  dogs  that is a picky eater so we added water and microwave his food for  sec  he loves his dinner  keeps it down  full disclosure hes not the dog with stomach problems  our boston terrier who we adopted from a puppy mill situation eats by gulping down her food from her years when she had to fight for food  she is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food she was having a problem with vomiting  regurgitation  the good news is if we get her to eat  small meals a day and try to get her to slow down problem solved  yet if she eats fastly without chewing regurgitation is still a problembr br i gave the food  stars because if we do make sure she chews it  by feeding her a couple morsels at a time like giving treats the food stays down therefore working for vomiting which was a huge proplem she was vomiting  times a day since switching she has stopped vomiting i dont think our dog is the only one that eats fast and it does take much longer to feed her
2344,5,my dogs love this natural kibble  its simple only rice and protein yet tasty  they maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements  wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dogs diet and keep it out of their food
2345,5,i have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years the vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet  i cant stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage but simple is a good alternative made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too  great product
2346,5,before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections he ate grain free food but he still got them both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean i really recommend itbr br while you can get it for  cheaper on other sites you pay  for shippingbr br i only wish amazon had more than  bags of it each time
2347,5,quality food but the price is very high  luv amazons free ship over 
2348,5,i was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough  after ordering it i got it two days later  the directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal  the toppings i added to my pizza were shrimp chicken cherry tomatoes mexican cheese blend and turkey canadian bacon  the pizza turned out great only  weight watchers point plus value per slice  this is a better alternative to other leading pizzas
2349,4,my husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough it was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone we put rossi pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great
2350,5,great stufflove that its organic and raw but later saw same thing  tjs for less than half the price
2351,5,i love this organic raw honeybr br when using it in my tea i dont need a lot and the taste is greatbr br honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it i also use it on my hair and face often the darker the better
2352,5,i absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at christmas and valentines day i would buy them all year if they were available so you can imagine how excited i was tao be able to get them for a while through amazoni can wait untill christmas when they will be available again
2353,5,cant find this flavor in the stores so bought them here online like them so much better than the peppermint ones i also like the cinnamon ones yumoas rachel ray states
2354,5,the local merchants quit stocking this was pleased to buy this on line so i can make french canadian pea soup again  stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor all of bobs red mill products are  star
2355,4,its hard to find this stuff locally usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit was pleased to find it on amazonbr br makes great tasty dhall we eat a lot of it so its nice to know i can get it here again when i need it
2356,5,bought these for a change from the green split peas they are tasty and i like them will buy again always like bobs red mill products
2357,2,when tea is decaffeinated is all the flavor removed or is this just lousy tea in any case all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a  oz mug of hot water ishot water true the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping but theres no tea flavor at all very disappointing
2358,5,full bodied tea no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping a great value for a good tea
2359,5,with the departure of starbucks coffees i reluctantly switched back to the other tdiscs carried by local stores i tried i really did but it seemed like every other one i tried which was basically every other one made including the european tdiscs were not rich enough to satisfy me i finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that i could make a nice rich cup i was still frustrated by the waste since im the only coffee drinker in my home plus being a basically lazy person i didnt enjoy filling the reservoir every time i wanted to brew a pot washing the pot out afterwards or cleaning out the grounds from the filterrecently tassimogevalia came out with a dark house blend the front of the package noted new if you like starbucks house blend try this as a last shot attempt before packing up my tassimo for storage i purchased this new tdisc coffee tasting my first sip i was so happy really really happy my coffee is so important to me and the gevalia dark house blend is amazing its a rich full bodied cup of coffee and as i drink this day after day im starting to think its even better than my old favorite starbucks flavors its as bold as starbucks with no bitterness at all id love to hear what others think of this i am very pleased with it and im so glad that i am able to go back to the simplicity of using my tassimo brewer because they make a great tdisc again
2360,5,this is the best thing from gevalia  i was drinking the starbucks africa and verona before the breakup  i tried the dark breakfast from gevalia but its horrible  i can only drink it after adding the maestro lorenzo espresso intensivo  that makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it  i even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bitbr br but this one is just right  its a nice strong cup that doesnt need cream but can take cream without losing flavor  this is the first hope i have had for saving my tassimo machine  i dont want to go back to the keurigbr br ps  i would still like a good decaf option  right now i use the gevalia signature decaf and add a shot of gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up
2361,5,ive tried all three new dark offerings from gevalia and i think this is the best one from the three gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guestsbr coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after tastebr br the pack comes with  big tdiscs that will brew  ounces of coffee this coffee will delight those who love the darker roastsbr br updatebr i am on my th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me changing from a  to  stars it is quite tasty and smooth this is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that sbux left there will be some that will say that this is not the same as sbux and it isnt try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings  highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again
2362,4,finally some new varieties of tassimo  i drink everything from dd to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway  this one is pretty much right on with the description  dark brew good medium body  it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans but i like this better than the sbux house coffeeits not quite as edgy and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for tassimo that i just dont like bc of their aftertaste bitter to me  this one brews at  degrees at least mine did which is a bit hotter than i would make a cup of latte for example at  so be careful on that first sip  but i do think this ones a keeper
2363,5,together with many customers i was frustrated when tassimo and starbucks ended their relationship my coffee was veronabr since that time i have tried various alternatives gevalia espresso tassimo carte noir tassimo nabob  kenco med roast but with limited and varying degrees of successbr after reading a previous review i sent off for a supply to test it  i love itbr br i was on the point of giving my tassimo machine away  no morebr br a great start to the new year
2364,5,i recently got a tassimo machine and really like it but the initial coffees that i tried were not as good as what i used to make by the pot this one finally blew everything else away its delicious the dark house blend is now my preferred tdisc when i want coffee since im not a coffee snob i dont like to get crazy with the adjectives but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor fullbodied is a good way to describe it as opposed to a lesserbodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it this is definitely the best coffee ive ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster it has no aftertaste and it is not bitter you can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it or add some cream even if you go heavy on the creamer it doesnt lose is flavor buy it and ignore the starbucks haters seriously starbucks coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be dunkin donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality
2365,5,i love this coffee its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk its a big cup size oz so its great in the morning when i dont want to get up for coffee too much if you have a tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand
2366,4,it tastes pretty decent but i wasnt aware how pricy they were when i bought them  i paid  for a pack of   what a rip off
2367,5,i loved the quality and the taste of these cookies they are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations to the person that posted a bad review just a small comment they are called meltaways because they have real butter go figure if you are interested in low fat food look elsewhere it like complaining that french fries are fried or that chocolate is fattening just saying
2368,5,these were so so good and i love that theyre made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute not aspartame or splenda  i looked at some atkins peanut butter cups id just bought and theyre a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies  i worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat unless its made with soybean oil or lists trans fat  i list this as one of my healthy snacks  and since im over  size  with no health problems  i must be on the right track of what healthy is br br one customer said hers were greasy  maybe hers were in the heat and the butter got hot  im now placing my third order for these theyre worth it
2369,3,i love these cookies but this paticular batch was stale very hard  i had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily
2370,4,my husband is gluten sensitive dairy sensitive and diabetic so it is very difficult to find desserts for him  usually if its gluten free it has waaaay too much sugar for example  i tried a box of these cookies for him  he tried them and said that they are surprisingly goodbr br they are not mereingues even though they are shaped like those types of cookies  they are regular cookie consistency  there are just a few in a package so they are rather expensive  however they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail  can you tell i have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook lol
2371,1,if you are ordering cookies beware the cookies arrived in crumbles so if you want a box of stale crumbs order away 
2372,1,two of aunt gussies cookies contain  of daily fat allowance  the cookies are so full of grease they fall apart  they may be sugar free and gluten free but they make it up with mostly fat  i cant even give them to my grandchildren
2373,5,i was looking for some nutritious snacks  with fiber  and came across these  ive tried this variety and the oatmealflax ones and both are very good they have a dryish texture but are full of flavor  wouldnt say theyre like home baked but there is no artificial taste at all theyre generous in size  inches diameter almost an inch high and though not calorie lightweights  each depending on the variety they have  grams of fiber each highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast
2374,5,after years of brandysoaked twinkies i just tried one of these tonight  wow  these are good  my wife was right  theyre good  but not so good you go crazy and eat the entire box  it may be the whopping  grams of fiber in these tiny little things  i think its actually my stomach screaming no more  i cant take any more fiber  im gonna blowbr br they remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy eucharist from the late s and early s  heavy moist wholegrain goodness  takes me back to my catholic school days  they used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy jesus after a mass  good times
2375,4,whole grain ingredients and good tasting  most kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix its nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth  there are several varieties of kashi cookies and they are all good
2376,3,they taste nice but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues because of the chicory root fiber it also made me bloated
2377,4,yes these are wonderful and healthy cookies but this is a rare bad deal from amazon really dab nutrition they are charging about  including shipping  in less than a minute of web searching i found the same quantity for about  shipped  enjoy the cookies but buy from someone else until the price comes down
2378,4,yummy good flavor i wish they were softer and not so crumblyand for some odd reason they give me heartburn and i never get heartburn i still like the flavor
2379,5,span classtiny length  minsbr br spanthese cookies are so great watch our video to see how great they really are
2380,5,these were shipped out the day after i ordered them and arrived within  days  i live on the opposite coast where these are made  my order arrived nicely packaged  for the price i got  lbs  oz of biscotti i weighed it on my kitchen scale cut into  big pieces  add the shipping and handling and that comes out to a little more than  per piece  this is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too when they have some  so i guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these daysbr br the flavor is very almondy and the hardness is just perfect  the biscotti is hard and crunchy but its not so hard that you couldnt eat it without dunking as some biscotti are  this biscotti can be eaten as is or can be dunked in coffee tea or cocoa  i dunked mine in chai tea and it tastes great  and the biscotti does not fall apart when dunkedbr br i like the almond flavor but i wish this came in anise flavor  thats my favorite biscotti flavor
2381,5,this coffee has a smooth carmely dark finish that i love my husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me this one is very smooth with just a hint of sweetness i wish that amazon had it on its monthly purchase program would love to save  on it however i was glad to find it someplace besides green mountain as prime members we can get our coffee replaced in  shipping days v a week or longer over at gm sweet
2382,5,this is the fifth different type of coffee ive tried with my keurig coffee maker right now it is tied with a newmans own kcup as my favorite a couple kcup products seemed fine when i first tasted them but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makesbr br this is a really smooooooooooooooooooth tasting coffee it does not have a strong taste but goes down very easily there is a richness to the taste as wellbr br bottom line i will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as i continue experimenting with different flavor kcups
2383,5,great coffee  rich robust  a coffeelovers choice  if you like french roast or italian roast you will like this coffee
2384,5,i am a coffee snob yes i admit it i prefer fresh roasted kenyan coffee but also like sumatran jamacan guatamalan even etheopian i generally say that i dont drink columbian most kcups are weak and less than stellar though i have found several i enjoy i was surprised by caribous mahogany it is excellent strong enough with an earthy winey taste and smoothe finish my description  i eagerly tried their daybreak to my disappointment just ordinary i dont often write reviews but if this can get someone else to enjoy mahogany it is well worth the time if you have similar taste in coffee give it a try and no i dont work for them
2385,5,i love this coffee very dark but not at all bitter i finally found one i like as much as jet fuel
2386,5,my husband loves strong caribou coffee but i like the milder one or breakfastbr type i will drink this but caribou of all kinds is a great coffeeno matterbr how strong it will not disappoint
2387,5,this morning for the first time in my life i tried mahogani caribou coffee only because i had run out of my usual type of coffee which i would usually brew and drink in short i should not even categorize mahogany caribou as coffee you know why it has far more antidepressant and uplifting effect on me than i had previously anticipated from now on i will only drink mahogany caribou
2388,5,you can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood  it is very smooth i detect no bitterness or over roasting  nice flavor  my newest favorite amoung the kcup line  my old favorite was donut shop but not any more  i am not as pleased with the other caribou flavors but this one really surprised me
2389,5,most caribou coffees are too weak for me this one is a delicious exception its right up there with revv emerils bold or van houttes eclipse a dark bold coffee without tasting burned or bitter
2390,5,caribous mahogany is my favorite kcup coffee  its got a great rich taste  its dark but not bitter
2391,5,it has a nice strong flavor with no bitternessbr br how strong is it i would say it is similar in strength to autodrip using  rounded tablespoon of coffee per oz of water
2392,5,ive been drinking green mountains dark magic and really enjoyed it however i wanted a change  after some searching i discovered this coffee and am glad i did  its got an excellent deep flavor that i really enjoy  strong enough  yet not overpowering  i recommend you give it a try
2393,4,i agree with the other positive reviews i see here  nice flavor strongish no bitter grindy or conference coffee flavors to mess it upbr br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americanobr br my favorite kcups arebr starbucks french roastbr starbucks caffe veronabr starbucks pike place roastbr green mountain xtra bold sumatran reservebr green mountain double black diamondbr green mountain revvbr green mountain dark magicbr br other kcups ive tried  coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger  starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold
2394,4,this coffee has a good flavor and a good strength  at first it seemed strong but then i got use to it  i recommend this flavor coffee good wake up in the morning
2395,4,very nice smooth cup of coffee  caribou coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time i visited minnesota and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee  i have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in kcups  i also enjoy the caribou blend but i have to say this blend has a little more kick to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste
2396,5,i hadnt tried caribou brand kcups before and am extremely picky  i like a rich intense wellbodied coffee and this product delivered  strong but no bitter taste when brewed with  oz water  i would recommend this product to anyone with similar tastes and will definitely buy it again
2397,5,this is one of my favorites  its smooth and rich and not too strong for morning but also bold enough that if i like a cup in the afternoon it will do for that too  my only problem is that i can never find it locally  i almost always have to get it online which is usually more expensive  ive tried the obsidian as a substitute and i dont like that one quite as much as the mahogany
2398,5,this is probably my favorite kcup so far im no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking if you say so but at my first sip of this dark smooth coffee i though chocolate its not flavored or sweet but for me it has a note of good dark chocolate highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor
2399,5,very smooth rich flavor even on the largest setting dark blend a very satisfying cup of coffee i will recommend this to my friends  this product arrived on time well packaged
2400,5,obviously taste is an opinion but in my humble opinion this is the best coffee out there for keurig and i have tried a billion i love dark roast but starbucks french roast sumatra and others i cant remember off hand seem to taste stale to me or not as bold cant stand any of caribous other dark roasts such as obsidian which you can get at target sometimes all in all i am hoping this one sticks around anges personal fav
2401,5,smooth full of flavor not bitter no nasty aftertaste people that like newmans extra bold starbucks verona and sumatra tullys french roast and other dark cup should love this  its better
2402,4,although ive only been able to try three of caribous k cup blends mahogany as well as a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductborgcaribou coffee caribou blend kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers counta and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvplicaribou coffee daybreak morning blend kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers counta ive found that caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups  they are head and shoulders above their competitors like green mountain and van houttebr br i should mention that caribous daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the  or so ive been able to sample so far  but i enjoy a flavorful medium roast  my boyfriend on the other hand prefers an extra bold dark roast  after our favorable experience with the caribou brand before we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blendbr br let me just say that mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor  its quite strong and dark but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts  this coffee packs a powerful punch  although that isnt normally my thing i can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener  my boyfriend adores it though and it has become a staple blend for him  i will still drink this on occasion but its a bit too potent for mebr br i think this is the best dark roast ive had the chance to try
2403,4,nice bold taste but with a little packaged overtone  like other kcup products this is just a shade below fresh
2404,5,got this in a k cup sampler the best k cup so far  if you like good strong coffee with a lot of flavor slight hint of cocoa this is it  no bitter after taste  this one goes on top of my reorder list perfect for the k cup system  the one reviewer on this post that gave it one star has no taste buds
2405,5,my wife and i are avid keurig coffee fans with three brewers between the two of us we started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the basics  we each have a couple of full strength and then go to the decaf for that last cupbr br mahogany is my choice for the full blend  its smooth has an excellent taste and aromabr br we are totally satisfied with this order 
2406,5,the name of this coffee is mahogany in my mind a deep rich brown the coffee flavor is deep and rich and the color is dark brown it is delicious
2407,2,carabou mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee i have ever had and ive been drinking coffee for over  decades it tastes just like a piece of burnt toast the only way i can make it palatable is to put it over ice add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk ive got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help
2408,5,i ordered the mahogany caribou coffee kcups and adore them  i recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste
2409,5,this is a serious cup of joe yummynessbr i have turned at least  friends onto this coffeebr robust and aeromatic
2410,5,this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made  i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself  but never in kcups  tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever
2411,5,i like the taste of this coffee tried the other brands but got stuck on this one i also like the eco friendliness of the company
2412,5,this is the best caribou kcup if you like a dark hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity  will definitely buy again
2413,5,i have been drinking tullys kona for the past  years but with the price increase of kona i needed to find something less expensive after trying numerous kcups this mahogany is just as good as the kona with a full coffee flavor and a hint of caramel i am happily converted
2414,4,i enjoyed this because of the full taste i get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste  to me it is a bit above the medium blend  i do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down i will definitely order more of this when im am out
2415,5,i could get very used to this  this is a nice strong robust coffee without bitterness  the kcups are so convenient and make no mess
2416,5,i really enjoy this coffee  i have used a variety of the kcups and this is one of the best
2417,5,strong smooth velvety flavor  mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking absolutely the best ive found my favorite
2418,5,of all the coffees ive tried  and ive tried a bunch  this is handsdown my favorite  great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste  i drink coffee all day and i like it strong and fresh  it can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee thats really great without cream or sugar i drink my coffee black  ive not yet found anything i like better  yum
2419,3,too mild for me i like a strong flavor my wife likes this coffee has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee if you like strong bold coffee you will be disappointed for a mild coffee i found this good but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brandsbr br i will not be reordering caribou mahogany my wife prefers donut shop brand over this again not strong enough for me but still makes a good cup of coffee
2420,5,if youre a fan of fullbodied coffees give this one a shotbr br for my taste the vast majority of kcups are too watery and weak even on the small cup setting so i gravitate towards the extrabold varieties  i had previously been enjoying newmans own extra bold and gm dark magic  after reading some favorable comparisons between those and mahogany i decided to give it a chancebr br i find that its slightly less bitter not that bitter is bad than newmans eb or dark magic and a little smoother  i also think its more full bodied without any burned bean flavor  ive tried the mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it  something ive never said before
2421,4,ive sampled many different kcup coffe types i prefer a really robust coffee and carbou mahogany really dosnt provide that i would cassify it as medium roast coffee with a smooth melow taste if that is what u are after  then give this blend a try
2422,4,no bitterness  a strong fullbodied cup but does not taste like ashes  smooth very drinkable  if you like bold dark coffee this will please
2423,5,in my office and for me personally this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your keurig machine great price too
2424,5,i have tried about every k cup brandcaribou mohogany is my all time goto brand  flavorful yet not strong and no jitters  you get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one
2425,5,if you like a bold cup of good coffeeand have a keurig single up brewer this is the flavor to buy  never dissappointing with carbou mahogany
2426,5,i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my keurig  i love the taste  i do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium  i use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is breakfast on the movea hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvpycaribou coffee mahogany kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers counta
2427,5,we love this coffee it is the best k cup weve found we like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed the prices on amazon cant be beat and the shipping super fast
2428,4,my husband enjoyed this coffee we usually use newmans extra bold but thought webr would try something different it was a bit too strong for me i prefer newmans but it wasbr still good
2429,3,this coffee is inoffensive but not strong enough for my tastes  i do use cream and im sure that makes a difference
2430,4,i like strong coffee but i dont want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste caribou coffees mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity  its one of my go to coffees when my favorites like coffee peoples wake up call are out of stock
2431,4,i like my coffee strong this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share
2432,5,love to order my coffee on amazon  easy and shows up quicklybr this k cup is great coffee  dcaf is very good as well
2433,5,one of the richer coffee for k cups we typically grind our own even for the keurig but the mahagoney from caribou is a great alternative order was shipped very quickly  will definitely buy again
2434,5,this is my favorite kcup coffee ive tried about twenty different types and so far everyone ive served it to really likes it a lot even the pickiest coffee connoisseur i know thought this kcup made an excellent cup of coffee two noncoffee drinking friends wish they liked coffee because they love the sound of caribou mahogany
2435,5,this is a great coffee  its dark but not bitter a little chocolaty and it reminds me of an adirondack lodge  i can get them for a better price in a caribou coffee store however
2436,5,ive tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same however this and the italian blend by timothys are two that are very good black or with creamsugar if youre looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors this is the one for you
2437,5,ive tried over a dozen varieties of kcups and this is by far my favorite  its strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor  this will be my choice from now on
2438,5,without beating it to death  if you like a full bodied but mellow brew this might be for you  it is hearty but not at all bitter  it holds a nice full body even when the keurig is set to the oversize setting  its now my favorite blend
2439,5,i go for the bold varieties of coffee and this mahogany is not only bold but very smooth  my all time favorite
2440,5,so far this is the only kcup ive found thats tastes great with a normal brew  its not watered down like the regular stuff and dosent taste burnt like the bold stuff they only kcup im buying from now on
2441,5,weve tried every coffee brand available for the keurig and this one is by far the best  its extraordinarily smooth and rich  the closest to starbucks if thats your thing  i add to it a healthy splash of bolthouse coffeemocha  very good
2442,5,the mahogany has a smooth full bodied character  i highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste
2443,3,this coffee is not really bold in my opinion  it falls more along medium roast flavor its a decent smooth coffee but i didnt think really bold like all kcups though seriously overpriced
2444,1,if you like strong coffee as i do this coffee is over rated i found it weak with a sickening after  taste
2445,3,this coffee is very full bodied and has a great aroma however it is the only kcup coffee ive had that has a bitter aftertaste i would still drink it if someone offered me a cup but i wont buy it again
2446,5,this was sold out at cafe express site  thrilled tobr find it here quick delivery and great service  happy to know that i can find it here
2447,5,my favorite blend of my favorite coffee  used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime i went out to the midwest now i can get in kcups  yay good price on amazon but super saver shipping takes forever fedexing it to the post office makes no sense  just fedex it to me and shave  days off the wait already
2448,4,this coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to starbucks brews  it doesnt have any bite to itbr if you like a mild coffee you will enjoy this one
2449,1,honestly im not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews  its a little weak but mostly just doesnt have a rich flavor  it is really missing something  i drink coffee black  maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar  before buying this coffee i had been drinking starbucks french roast and folgers black silk both of which taste so much better than this coffee
2450,5,let me be honest i wasnt expecting this to be very good i received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before i was brave enough to give it a tastebr br at first sip it was much sweeter than i expected it to be i could certainly taste the pineapple but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than i thought it would be it was good i very much enjoyed the taste of the drink it was exotic and refreshing it was much fuller in weight as i was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavorbr br the box reminded me of those chocolate milks that i buy for my kids but it didnt detract from the flavor
2451,5,i have been buying one coconut water with a splash of pineapple regularly for awhile now i like the flavor and ordering it on line is very convenient also i have had no problems with deliverybr br unfortunately iprozon has just lost my business  i didnt mind paying  for a case of   i will not however pay  for a case of   that is robbery  i can walk into fred meyer grocery and buy a case of  for   plus there are other sites still selling it for  per case  i noticed iprozon is still selling the other flavors of one coconut water for  for a case of   so what on earth are they thinkingbr br i am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information but i am willing to do that versus paying nearly  for a case of   quite ridiculous
2452,5,i was exhausted hot and dehydrated when i spotted this in a concourse store at jfk airport  i was about to get on a  hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying  but juice sounded too heavybr id heard the rumblings about coconut water so i looked to see if i liked any of the flavor options  i cant stand mango and just about everyone adds it i was relieved to see the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple so i figured id give it a gobr the woman at the counter said are you sure you want that its  steep but its an airport what can you do by that point i was so wanting to try it i said sure  after all it wouldve been  for a sticky sweet sodabr i was so happy with it that i kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time i traveled so i would know which one it was  it doesnt taste heavy in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water  its amazingbr i was happy to find it on amazon  as im definitely hookedbr since i have prime shipping it gets to me in  days if i order it right that is which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stockbr im totally thrilled with this stuff
2453,3,we loved this product and i just received my new order  i noticed the packing changed which made me check the label  the ingredients and nutritional information has changedbr br old ingredients  nutrition samplebr natural coconut waterbr natural pineapple juicebr cane juicebr vit cbr natural fruit flavorbr sodium mgbr potassium mgbr sugar gbr vit c br calcium br iron br br new ingredients  nutrition samplebr coconut waterbr pineapple juicebr sugarbr ascorbic acidbr natural flavorbr sodium mgbr potassium mgbr sugar gbr calcium br iron br magnesium br vit c br  juicebr br maybe the new box is misprinted as it says  juice and the packaging clearly says a splash of pineapple and other natural flavorsbr br no thank youill be cancelling my subscription  i dont why the change
2454,1,please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product we just cancelled our subscription of  cases per month because the new formula is disgusting not buying again unless the change back to the old version
2455,5,o n e coconut water is delicious and refreshing it is amazing how it rids me of cramps in my calves and lower back
2456,5,this drink is perfect for the summer it is a healthy alternative to soda and a great way to hydrate your body i know this isnt the healthiest coconut water on the market it does have cane sugar but its the best one for those who are new to coconut water or just dont prefer something as natural as pure coconut water my brother hates coconut waterbut loves this stuff this drink is not too sweetand has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together i like vita cocos fruit infused waters as well but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day
2457,5,i happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped  keep those afternoon headaches away
2458,5,i got the one coconut water wsplash of pineapple  its delicious  not the least bit sweet  just very refreshing  love it and will continue using it  saw this on dr oz as he recommended it
2459,5,i saw this item in my local grocery store and i thought i would give it a trybr br i have to admit i was very surprised about how much i enjoyed this item  i found it refreshing and i felt that i had a bit more energy i would happily purchase this product again and againbr br a word of advice to people complaining that it doesnt taste coconutty enough  coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things  coconut water comes from a green immature coconut while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconuta hard brown fiber covered shell  just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different the same can be said of coconut  if you dont think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada you will probably enjoy it even more
2460,5,this is the best drink out there  ive always had adult acne and no matter what i took or what the dermatologist prescribed for me it has always been so difficult to treat my acne  i started drinking coconut water for the electrolyte benefits after my intense spinning classes but i noticed within several weeks that my face started to clear up and actually looked smoother  besides keeping me hydrated and my electrolytes in balance it has improved the quality of my skin tone  love it
2461,4,i started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend  i never really loved the taste of it but i spend a great deal of time in the desert and i just cant seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged so i was excited when i found flavors  i know that recently its become trendy and much harder for me to find but my friends have been drinking it for years as has my yoga instructor and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports but also to keep hydrated  plus its done wonders for my always dry skinbr br if nothing else its a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance
2462,5,i admit that i fully expected to dislike this product and approached it with a dismissive attitude  something thats this trendy cant be any good right well i was wrong the one coconut water is refreshing delicious and just barely sweet really wonderful stuff the hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water i bet this would make a great summer drink too but i only had one so i didnt get tot try that my problem now is that its been out of stock so i cant get more
2463,5,i decided to try this although i am not a big fan of flavored waters  it is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions  i happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix  the one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition even a splash puts it up front and center  this added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some  it would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or in my case after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the northeast
2464,2,ughi tried this as a replacement for the coconut water with pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program  this stuff is awful  its got added sugar which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross  never getting this stuff again  and i do love coconut water in general as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than gatoradewell usually  not this stuff
2465,5,being a ride leader with a bicycle club i use coconut water with its high potassium and vitamin c as an energy drink i prefer this product to that you find in ethnic markets because it has no added sugar and it hasnt been boiled
2466,5,coconut water with a splash of pineapplebr br this is refreshing  its sweet but not too sweet  the coconut flavor isnt pronounced and the pineapple isnt so overpowering that it tastes like syrup  its clean tasting  according to the packaging it has five essential electrolytes more potassium than a banana no fat no cholesterol and no preservatives  theres a smidge of fiber  g of protein and  g of sugars  i suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple but cane juice is one of the ingredients too the  fl oz carton comes to  caloriesbr br if you sign up for subscribe  save its less than  per carton  actually the carton is the only thing i dont like about this drink  its sort of hard to drink directly from because there isnt any air getting let in when you drink which makes a vacuum  this was solved by pouring it into a glass  whewbr br this was good  i will definitely get more and i highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice
2467,2,almost gagged at first taste i have used other coconut based products water milk cooking oil etc and this is the first time i have been disappointed my teenage kids hated it my son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he couldnt stand it i am sure done is not the healthiest but one you try that there is no comparison in flavor tolerance
2468,5,i love this stuff really i do i have tried all of the flavors but i havent tried the original i have to say by far pineapple is my favorite guava is a close second who am i kidding i love them allbr br despite what others say about it tasting best at room temperature i find it tastes very refreshing and even better when on ice if you want a natural tasty alternative to water this is for you
2469,5,since i had been recuperating from a  hour flu bug that lasted abr week i knew i was low on electrolytes  i opted for this productbr as some products tend to further aggravate my stomach andbr acid reflux  this worked out extremely well and the tastebr is good  i will keep it on hand from now on
2470,5,i have tried all the different brands of coconut water and one is my favorite and one coconut water with a splash of pineapple is my favorite flavor i wish the price would come back down i absolutely love this stuff
2471,3,to me this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut  there is an underlying hint of coconut i know the water isnt strongly flavored but i wasnt expecting so much pineapple  this is tangy and sweet  it is alright  package is smaller but i dont think i could handle too much more of it in one sitting  i am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water it is too tangysour to me so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me  not sure id buy this again  still in search of the one i first tried and fell in love with but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting
2472,3,i didnt expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty even if it does replace electrolytes so that was offputting  its not really bad especially over ice but i wont be ordering any more of it
2473,3,this is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand  the container is smaller there is no straw and i like the taste of the plain one better  it is ok
2474,1,ive had amy and brians coconut water  yum vicos plain in the tetra pack  great the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate  blah and yuck dont get those  and the ones in the glass bottles green cover cant remember the name but pure coconut water great toobr br this one with pineapple no good  the added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice  it makes the water taste thicker and not so healthybr br i wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients ie coconut water and pineapple juice  no more
2475,2,i love coconut and pineapple but i was not wild about the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple it wasnt bad  it had a mildly coconutty though not sweet flavor but it just wasnt anything special it was rather bland and i had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up since im not a competitive athlete and dont have any great need to replenish my electrolytes id rather just drink water
2476,4,then one coconut water with a splash of pineapple is the drink for you  i found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage  according to the package one coconut water with a splash of pineapple contains natural coconut water natural pineapple juice cane juice vitamin c and natural fruit flavor  personally with the coconut and the pineapple i think they could have left out the sugar canebr br however when i paired one coconut water with a splash of pineapple with a light snack of cheese and crackers it became a very tasty refreshing drink  i apparently needed a little salt andor savory to make one coconut water with a splash of pineapple completely palatable  with the afore mentioned snack the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple is really delightful  i can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today not so much with the cold winter weatherbr br one coconut water with a splash of pineapple comes in a handy  oz box with a place to punch a straw through  this type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids  just throw it in your bag and gobr br prior to this experience i had not heard of coconut water  on the packaging it says one coconut water with a splash of pineapple is a blend of the natural water from inside a young green coconut and sweet golden pineapple juice it has five essential electrolytes more potassium than a banana no fat no cholesterol and no preservatives  huhwho knew you could drink a green coconut  educational and a good source of potassium  being allergic to bananas it is always good to have another sourcebr br overall i would not drink one coconut water with a splash of pineapple by itself in the middle of winter  but together with nonsugary snack or in the high heat of summer i would definitely give one coconut water with a splash of pineapple another try
2477,4,this seems like a pretty straightforward drink its coconut juice and its pineapple juice with a bit of sugar and not much elsebr br they claim its a good source of potassium and electrolytesbr br for me it was pretty tasty granted it was also very sweet is it a health drink i dont know if id go that far it has vitamin c and trace amounts of calcium  iron but not much else other than sugarbr br for what it is something sweet to sip its pretty good
2478,3,my top line advice if you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple get the vita coco not this onebr br size the size is  fl oz per package i didnt pay close attention when ordering and expected the larger  oz size not a big deal and was my fault but its a little too small to be usefulbr br taste ick i love coconut water i love pineapple juice i love lightly flavored coconut water this tastes like none of the above the flavor is sickly sweet ingredients included added sugar and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters ive tried might as well be a processed kids drinkbr br alternatives while i actually prefer ones regular unflavored coconut water over other brands the vita coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one it comes in a larger package doesnt have added sugar has more vitamins and nutrients this one is diluted with sugar water and tastes like youre drinking it fresh on the beach this one is justnot great
2479,3,i wanted to try this juice as im a big fan of coconut flavoured products  given that it claims to have a splash of pineapple i was expecting a light pinacolada flavourbr br on opening the package i could smell the hint of pineapple and id say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water  probably because ive mostly tasted coconut milk and not water id say this was nothing like what i expected  its not bad for thirst quenching but it wasnt my favourite drink in terms of taste
2480,3,hi every one i just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product first off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others its more like a juice drink than a healthy one compared to vitacoco it has more calories twice the sodium half the potassium and almost half the vitamin c this drink also has less magnesium phosphorous and  times less calcium the only this the drink does have over vitacoco is the  less gram of sugar overall pay the extra price and get a better drink for your body and if you dont believe me go to the websites and check the facts below or check it out on their web sitebr br one coconut water with splash of pineapplebr calories br fat br cholesterol br sodiummg br potassiummg br carbsg br fiber br sugar gbr protein gbr br vitamin c br calcium br magnesium br phosphorous br iron br br compared tobr br vitacoco with splash of coconutbr calories br fat br cholesterol br sodiummg br potassiummg br carbsg br fiber br sugar gbr protein gbr br vitamin c br calcium br magnesium br phosphorous br iron 
2481,2,im usually into pineapple and coconut drinks but this drink just didnt taste all that great to me the taste doesnt resemble anything close to a pina colada flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it  it just tastes tangy and a little sour like water that has a bit of sugar and sourness to it yeah not really a taste i crave im not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink but it just didnt appeal to me i really wanted to like it though because as i said before i usually love pineapple coconut drinks
2482,2,this product is billed as an all natural antioxident and electrolyte replacing beverage  sort of like allnatural gatorade with antioxidentsbr br like a sports beverage it too is also kinda bland  i love some of the gatorade flavors some not so much  this drink falls into the not so much category for mebr br it is sorta sweet sorta pineappley and also sorta bland  my wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth like the glass had soap in it still  i didnt think it was that bad but the drink really didnt appeal to mebr br in the end yes this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch  but as a sports drink i think ill stick with plain old gatorade its cheaper and contains fewer calories per servingbr br if going the all natural route with your juicesdrinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to  stars
2483,2,i received a single  once container of one coconut water with a splash of pineapple as part of the amazon vine program for reviewbr br it would have been nice if it had come with a straw especially considering the price of the product now as to the splash of pineapple well it must not have been a very big splash because i never did taste any pineapple so what did i taste it is hard to describe it doesnt taste like coconut or cane sugar or any natural fruit flavorbr br to be honest it tastes like watersort of like water with an odd undefinable extra flavor its not a bad flavor or a good flavor its just meh flavor i dont care how healthy this drink is supposed to be for its price it should have a better flavor or just have a flavorbr br and as a thirst quencher it doesnt equal up to gatorade or even a lemonade i feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst
2484,2,coconut water with a hint of pineapple shipped to the us from indonesia packaged in usually nonrecyclable disposable containers and catering to the sports drink market good source of electrolytesbr br i took a   ounce container and poured  servings for  teenagers and  adults  first impression  the teens serious athletes were not told what the drink was but i did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drinkbr br the result  no negative votes but no one would choose it over existing drinks  everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly  it leaves a strange feeling in my mouth one teen said  this was probably the coconut water it had a residual flavor and feelbr br there was no straw included with the package so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife  its mostly cane sugar water so why botherbr br but the biggest issue is the waste  coconut sugar water from indonesia  whats the carbon footprint of this product  and the container has  recycle symbols on it but like milk cartons it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfillbr br bottom line  its not that tasty being little more than sugar water and the transport and packaging waste really dont fit into a culture for me focusing on sustainability
2485,5,this is a close second to my alltime favorite jack links beef steakhouse steaks which is the filet mignon of beef jerky theyre very similar in taste and price but the steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly still pretty awesome jerky very tender and not a hint of fat or gristle bon appetit
2486,5,actually sojos strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw but it an be cooked as i choose to do  my dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy  through veterinary mismanagement he was never completely healthy for the first   years of his life  after watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his inflammatory bowel disease i took him to a holistic veterinarian  part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of sojos and meat plus no medications  im extremely pleased to report he has had no gi episodes in over  months and has reached a point where i consider him healthy  his coat is glossy and much fluffier than before hes finally at a good weight  i have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvementmuch of which i credit to sojosbr br it does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble but i make  days worth at a time this takes me about    minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after  to be completely honest im not thrilled about cooking for my dog but i am thrilled with the results  if i was able to feed him raw perhaps down the road when our vet gives the ok preparation time would  be almost nothing
2487,5,sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of  you do not need to add calcium or phosphorus
2488,5,i feed my dogs sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food  i recommend sojosbr br but i had a problem with the amazon purchase  amazon stored the sojos bag in the original mailing box sojos sent them  my order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me  the bag of sojos was almost one year old and there was no way amazon kept track of that  i got a refund from amazon with no question and very quickly but amazon needs to keep control of the useby dates of food they offer on their site
2489,5,i have three newfoundlands so we go through a lot of food  one of the dogs has had severe health issues and since weve switched from commercial kibble to home made food hes thrived  he gets regular blood tests to monitor the drugs hes on and they have been perfect since we started on sojos  it will not cure his issues but he has more energy and he cant wait for meal time  the other two are glowing with health as well  all three dogs coats are shiny and they have tons of energy for a newf
2490,4,i think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week
2491,5,my small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like solos so long as i mix it with some good people food he hasnt had problems digesting it  delivery was prompt as expected
2492,5,i have a now  month old male shih tzu  when i brought him home from the breeder i kept him on the pro plan puppy tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished  there was about  cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as i put it down  as a test i rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happenhed eat about  pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with which i was happy with as i dont want to play with his food as a game to get him to eat  i went and got him blue buffalo dry puppy food lamb and oatmeal formula which had bigger size kibbles  it seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones venison antler lamb lung chips for comfort  again when i got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag he would walk away from the bowlthis went on for almost  days  he was still having small bowel movements urinating drinking water and playing running and continuing his successful training exercises called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by science dietveterinarians diet after the exam which showed nothing physically wrong  the one vet tech said that shih tzus tend to be picky eaters  i didnt pick up the food at their check out counter left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet  i know from some of our outdoor excursions that hes attracted to road kill hell sniff the air and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devicesbut i wont allow it  i remember being a kid in the late s early s and all my friends who had dogs fed them  of  choices available back then gravy train or alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat they ate bones etc and all lived into their late teens  one of my friends small mutt lived to be  years old  i never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem since i grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance  well i read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighsbreasts  my weston isnt a big fan of totally raw meat but when browned i put it in the toaster oven and add  tsp of missing link to the meat portion with the soaked sojos original he eats with gusto  from his early days i would play with and take his food away so hes not food aggressive  he eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done  weston then wants to play hard train hard take a nice walk and nap  his coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed  the droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up  i just had him neutered  days ago and he ate this sojos mix with the same gusto even with the ecollar to challenge him  so i am a fan and we are finished with the second  lb bag and i just ordered another one  hope this helps someone with a picky eater i know another reviewer mentioned their shih tzu not liking it but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other much like us humans
2493,4,i didnt mean to order a pound bag but i did wow thats a lot of food be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress
2494,1,sojos diet lacks calcium and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog  this diet requires supplementation with a balanced calciumphosphorous additive to be safe
2495,5,i was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my vet  my  year old springer who has never been much into doggie bones loves these things  they make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation  my old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles  i have a younger springer who also loves the bones but she doesnt need much motivation to do anything ha but they are also great training aids  i also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter i had at my home for his  dogs and he said they loved them tooso i guess thats antidotal but thats  dogs that really love the things  oh the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your vet about twice as much per pound so this is a great buy  buy a nice food safe container from home depot and fill it up  you wont run out of bones for a while and thats a good thing
2496,3,it doesnt have a whole lot of flavor but most light roasts dont  it does have a unique flavor but is kind of rich and tiring so i recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better
2497,4,it seems most of the organicshade grownfair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted so ive been having a hard time finding something that i like  while this doesnt wow me like some other coffees its priced cheaper than those coffees and its a good brew for when im not really paying attention to what im drinking like when im workingbr br im definitely going to keep this one around and just switch to the expensive better coffees that ive found when i can really enjoy thembr br compared to other coffee thats not organicshade grownfair trade this is an average light roast  good but nothing to get excited over  its worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices
2498,5,i recently moved and couldnt find a thai restaurant nearby my favorite meal at my old thai place was massaman curry i used the recipe on the back on the package when i got it and it was just like what i get at the restaurant excellent flavor
2499,5,we love to get masaman curry at our local thai restaurant but i havent been able to find a paste that actually tastes like it  this paste does and is very easy to prepare  just add some coconut milk and heat  add your protein and veggies of choice done  i have now bought some of the other mae ploy products and found them all very good quality with authentic flavors
2500,5,this is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store  if you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity  this is a good deal and super easy to use
2501,2,this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry at the time i loved it made it all the time then i discovered a better brand of curry paste hand brand curry paste premium stuff amazon doesnt sell  hint to amazon stock it but you can get it at  its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy a huge difference i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal very bland boring by comparison also as a side note these are very small containers i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store these are like  the size of those ones not a good deal if you can find it locally
2502,5,i ordered this product to send to my friends husband they had just moved to alabama in the end of march she could not find any diet peach snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in new jersey he said that the water that was used down south made the diet peach snapple taste different  so now she is happy because she has found  a source that they can buy his snapple from  thank you
2503,5,this peach flavored diet tea by snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summers day its truly a diet teathere are zero calories its best served chilled and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves theres also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring they use filtered water as well this tea is sweetened somewhat with aspartame but snapple adds in just the right amount so that its not excessively sweet if you want really tea that is rather sweet youll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener it also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for youbr br if you have other questions the company has a toll free number so that people can contact thembr br overall this tea is perfect for a hot summers day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle i highly recommend this product
2504,5,previously i bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter but the mustard i made with this seed is very tasty and after mellowing a few days not bitter at all pleasantly spicy
2505,4,in my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types this is one of my new favorites  great taste and although a hefty calorie count the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run if a real meal just is not an option  very satisfying  i also tried the white sesame crunch and that is ok too but this one wins for taste
2506,5,mrs mays pumpkin crunch is a great snack for those of you watching calories and intake be aware that the oz portions are two servings most of mrs mays products are great but with the fat at g per serving i find its not a complete guilt free snack however the pumpkin seed crunch has gms of protein per serving vs the usual gms in their other snacks so if youre monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunchbr br that said they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you just a little high in fat if youre watching your weight
2507,5,i love to put a bag of pumpkin crunch on the table at work and watch peoples faces light up when they taste them  try it
2508,5,mrs mays pumpkin crunch is the best of the bunch  if you like pumpkin seeds this is for you  the slightly sweet cubes make me think i am eating cake  these are great for snacking and even dessert a truly wonderful product and glutenfree into the bargain
2509,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbehamamrs mays dryroasted snack pumpkin crunch ounce pouches pack of abr pumpkin crunch is greatbr stick with oz size  servingsbr much too easy to consume entire oz bag without realizing itbr d lol
2510,5,it has good tast and crunchy i bought black sesame before it is good too highly recommanded
2511,5,i picked this up at my local grocery store in the seasonal aisle with the easter goodiesbr br this moist cake mix can be made with or without eggs i used them and wasnt the least bit disappointedbr br i paired the cake with pilsburys pink lemonade frosting too but you could have it totally unfrosted if youd like you will still love itbr br perfect for the family dessert childrens cupcakes or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea if you love pink lemonade you are going to love thisbr br the color just screams spring and easter and the taste will leave you screaming for another bitebr br i give this stars and my thumbs up
2512,5,i normally bake from scratch but when i saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting i just had to try them both this cake can be made two ways with or without egg yolks i recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result this cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar you can make it as a layer bundt or sheet cake or as cupcakes i picked it up at the grocery store recently for about  per box the frosting was about the same price per can i ended up going back and purchasing more for later as i believe this is just a seasonal flavor and pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point if they do i hope they bring it back every spring until then ill be stocking up
2513,5,like i said about the icingi am so happy to be able to buy this online it is a family favorite it also was shipped on time and arrived early definitely going to buy again
2514,5,i picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles the cake was heavenly i liked it so much i found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which i bought but havent tried yetbr br the taste is of course lemon but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix country time i drank as a kid but less tangy its very light and refreshingbr br i simply loved it hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor
2515,5,i tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the storesbr with no success did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked upbr great product
2516,5,this is a great product so its no surprise that the local shelves are often cleared of it especially early in the season purchasing in bulk through amazoncom is a dependable alternative bayer in in granular form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic insecticide for up to  weeks but youll need a separate fungicidaldisease treatment and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible bayer assures me the product is safe for pollinators and earthworms
2517,5,i have been a rose gardner for many years i remember when this product was made by ortho and called rose pride  this product really helps with the pests and diseases that roses tend to acquire  though it does not stop all pests cane borers it stops the major ones that cause serious damage and spread disease  i treat all my plants on the same monthly regiment and make sure to do it every four to six weeks making a note on my calendar  like one other reviewer said you will not see immediate results with this since it is systemic  for the best results make sure to read the package and work the granules  into the soil and water in
2518,5,i have been plagued by white flies for over a year neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely i decided to try this as its made by a respected international brand  i thought a systemic product might workbr a week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week i started to notice less  less of the little vermin by the time i was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub i had even used it on potted plants which were also infested  it worked on everythingbr remember the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully  also if like me you dont always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every  weeks is certainly a lot easier to use
2519,1,theres one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is not for use in containers why hide that info to make more sales of course youll only learn that if you read their q  a on their website i studied the labels and opened the back label and its never mentioned you cant use it on potted plants thanks bayernow i have to go back to the store to return it i guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died not knowing its because of this product if you see your bees dwindle and disappear then this is the reason will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers after  years of use they will not have a fragrance got earthworms you wouldnt know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt avoid this
2520,3,the active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid  it is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves but not the flowers i learned recently online  i have been using this stuff for years and obseved this but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules  unless you spray the flowers with another product containing the insecticide the japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alonebr  see linkbr 
2521,5,works wonderfully for most all applications in the garden could not be easier since it is systemic and helps fertilize only what you want to fertilize
2522,1,if i could give this product a minus  stars i would  there is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder  this us has yet to ban this pesticide but it has already been banned in other countries avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin
2523,5,these chips are good to sprinkle on salad use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal  very pleased
2524,5,this is the best mustard my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great
2525,5,this is the best ive ever eaten  if you like mustard and you likebr horseradish this is the product to trybr my first experience with thomy was several years ago when my son livedbr in germany  he used to send it home but after he moved back to thebr states the supply was cut off  but when you notified me that it wasbr available i was ecstaticbr the blend is delicious and goes well with your favorite crackers andbr cheese appetizers or with anything you enjoy with mustard  it addsbr that little zingbr give it a try you wont be sorry
2526,5,this mustard is not for the mildmannered but for those who truly appreciate great german food  this product is original as sauer kraut und rot kohl  its taste is very original and authentic for those who will appreciate a bit of zip in their mustard  try it on brats burgers etc and you simply wont be disappointed  alles gute  jim
2527,5,there isnt much to say about this mustard other than ummm ummm good  i tried this for the first time at a bbq on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meatnow i use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade caesers dressing  youll love it
2528,5,great with bratwurst breakfast sausages salami cheddar cheese sandwiches etc even though it is a bit exoticexpensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background its best to keep it simple and let it stand out
2529,5,it arrived on time and was packaged well  this was my first try of this mustard  it was unique similar to many other hot mustards but i favored it over the others i have because of the balance of flavors  its almost as hot as english colemans mustard but a little sweeter and maybe a slight vinegar essence in it the tube and a bag of pretzels lasted me one or two evenings
2530,5,we became acquainted with this mustard when we were in switzerland and really enjoyed it that was our reason for purchasing it great find we have liked this as much as the one that we bought in europe
2531,5,the lobster bisque is absolutely delicious nice lobster flavor i cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup just open heat and enjoy ive become such a fan of the baxters line that i cant wait to try them all
2532,5,baxters soups are usually very nice but the lobster bisque is especially good it tastes authentic it has a good flavour is creamy and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurantbr br its also surprisingly low calorie though the nutrition info here says  calories for oz the label actually says  calories so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about  calories
2533,5,no doubt about it this is just the right combination of lobster scampi prawns with a hint of dry white wine  a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfectionbr ingredientsbr water lobster  cod  scampi  concentrated tomato paste modified cornflour white wine prawns  skimmed milk powder butterfat double cream salt yeast extract sugar shrimp powder fish powder vegetable oil vegetable extracts stabiliser polyphosphates brandy concentrated lemon juice spices herb and spice extracts with celerybr no artificial coloursbr no artificial flavoursbr no artificial preservativesbr br informationbr gluten freebr contains milk fish shellfish celery
2534,2,the taste is good but i found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable this made me not want to finish my bowl of soup
2535,3,this soup is very good tasting if you like seafood like i do i am finally finishing my case of cans because it is good food however i do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra bits and pieces of chitinous shell mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster they are small pieces which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything and dont eat the last spoonful i find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can like i said before i am finishing the case because it is food and pretty good at that but i just dont appreciate having to be that careful with my soup
2536,2,it is ok soup but i expected more as i love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there i guess it is ok for the price but i would never buy this brand of the lobster bisque again
2537,4,this was actually a gift to my daughter along with  cases of other baxters soups shes of the opinion that baxters is absolutely the best canned soup on the planet of the soups shes tasted which include the major american brands  she doesnt cook much the lobster bisque rated just below baxters scottish smoked salmon which she rated the best ever from my own perspective and usually cooking my own food i have to admit that the baxters soup line for canned soup is superior
2538,3,for canned soup it hits the spot decently  theres definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it  however the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side  if i was served this in a restaraunt i think id walk out
2539,1,i gave this product a one because zero wasnt an option  this is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it  the only lobster in the soup was some shell  it was salty fishy nasty and inedible  not only that but  of the  cans were dented  a complete waste of money  beyond disappointing  it made me angry
2540,4,this soup is pretty good not great i put some heavy cream  oz and some tabasco in it i have had a lot better lobster bisque  but at a much higher price
2541,1,saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can opened can heated soup tasted soup dumped soup down drain rinsed mouth with mouthwash enough said
2542,3,as someone who lives and dies by seafood ive had my fair share of lobster bisque this stuff while not completely horrible needs some love before its decent the texture isnt quite there not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either as for the taste its rather bad a little on the bland side as a marylander i reached for the one thing that fixes all things seafood old bay dumped in a liberal amount and stirred while still on the heat the old bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat doubt ill be purchasing this brand again though
2543,2,as far as canned soups go this is ok i was disappointed with the texture extra unexpected bits shell pieces and overall quality having been spoiled by living in maine for  years before relocating to the south i tried different brands of canned bisque i have come to the realization that lobster bisque is best when made fresh
2544,1,this is one of the worse tasting soups ive ever eaten i hated it and now i have a full case  it tastes bitter to me and my husband wouldnt even try it  only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter
2545,3,i advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you the tomally functions as the lobsters liver and pancreas however even in the cold scottish waters dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public i was disappointed to discover this information so i only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors
2546,5,in europe you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet a great source of omega oil you can improve your health by eating these tasty nutty seeds they are good for the gut and good for the heartbr br the golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nutbrown seeds they look nice in baked goods like lighter breads they taste the same as the dark seeds ground they dont show up in white bread so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiberbr br we like them sprinkled on oatmeal muesli or yogurt
2547,5,ive been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits i was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company these are the best tasting flaxseeds i have ever had to get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder we usually grind  tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade crystal light or tea and drink it down quick before it expands flaxseeds are loaded with minerals vitamins amino acids and fiber they are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation there are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately its against the review guidelines to post links so ill just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google
2548,5,flaxseed is a great way to get fiber in your diet and this brand delivers  it has a mild taste i put  tablespoons in my morning smoothie and gives you  of your daily fiber required intake  flaxseed also contain omega  so you also place a powerhouse of nutrients in your diet with this little seedbr br an excellent source of protein fiber and minerals such as magnesium and copper how can you go wrong
2549,5,its best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega since you are grinding the seeds yourself the released omega  oils are at their freshestbr br i recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer you can keep them there after you open them as well i grind  tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake good stuff
2550,5,bobs red mill organic golden flaxseeds are an excellent way to ingest some omega    ounces are delivered in  packs and if you dont use it all immediately i suggest storing the seeds in the freezer to keep them fresh  grind them right before you use them and they have a mild taste  milder than brown flaxseed ive ordered this product several times and the quality has been consistently high
2551,5,good product but remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we cant digest whole flaxseeds
2552,5,this is funny i bought the flax seed to make  a neck warmer  i made said to use flax seed and warm in microwave for  minutes  bought  bags only needed  so decided to make use of the rest grind and put over any food the benifits are greatbr i put mine in yogert and cereal will diffently keep useing after this last bag will be ording again
2553,5,i enjoy this flaxseed in everything ive tried it in so far this product has a pleasant flavor yet doesnt over power the foods i put it in it helps to keep my digestive track regular i ground it in my coffee grinder and just sprinkle it on just about everything my husband and i love it in pancakes i enjoy it in my cereals and even on ice cream i especially like it mixed in my yogurt i highly recommend this product
2554,5,i ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you  i ordered a grinder both were reasonably priced and the grinding was so easily accomplished  i have been using flaxseed daily since that time and the claims made on the internet have proven to be true  the product arrived on time and in great shapei have purchased from this vendor several times and have not been disappointed
2555,5,ive recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol i add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables i feel better lost some weight and have stopped having heart flutters im now looking forward to having my next blood work done to see how well it has helped highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way
2556,5,bought this as a way to take in omega  nutrient the pack of  has lasted me almost a  year you have to grind up the seeds and freeze the rest no complaints very reasonable pricing
2557,5,we are very happy with these organic golden flaxseeds  we grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form  these are now a staple in our house
2558,5,i have very little to say about the product except that it is a great product and their delivery subscription works very well
2559,5,great for you grind them up and add a few tablespoons cant tell its there in your cereal ect
2560,3,i have bought ground flax in the store there was always a rancid aftertaste  this is the best tasting flax i have ever had  but i have to throw it in the coffee grinder and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds  i found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole  nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit isbr br after you grind sift the powder and black stones will be evident  i have about  per quarter cup of ground mixture  perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to i am notbr br i have only used  bag so far so i cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others but i highly doubt it was a fluke bag
2561,5,this brand always makes good products since you buy bulk they turn out to be quite cheaper than in the supermarket very clean flaxseeds i add it to my smoothies to bath my joints with some natural raw omegas supposedly they are better if eaten sprouted though havent tried it
2562,5,these flaxseeds are of good quality i eat them daily  bought the whole seed rather than the ground seed because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own  will buy again  i read that whole seeds can pass undigested and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time  so we grind a weeks worth at a time  best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well  or in a cold cereal or added to a cup of coffee for a twist seem to blend better in hot foods
2563,2,i wasnt thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of gravel the flax seeds themselves were fine top quality if it werent for the gravel bits that get through the sieve wthe seeds i guess this would get  stars
2564,5,its also a routine baking ingredient i put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour i also put it into my smoothie stir fry dishesanything you can think of good price and really its a must have for a healthy diet
2565,5,looks fresh and clean i have roasted it in the toaster oven and i also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder
2566,5,these are excellent quality flaxseeds i just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack i also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too  delicious  nutritious  awesome  planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies i think i will also try out bobs quinoa and museli
2567,5,this is the nd order i have placed for bobs red mill organic flaxseed it is a good quality whole flaxseed we grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt it keeps a long time in the freezer i have been using this flaxseed for about a year now eating a tablespoon about every day and have noticed that my skin is softer  plus it keeps me regular if ya know what i mean  flaxseed is also a good way to get in some of the omega s that the body needs
2568,3,it was my mistake  i thought there were  bags rather than  so the price per bag is much higher than what i pay at the local grocery for the same product
2569,4,the flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook i purchased  this seed was cheaper than other brands i had checked on  i am putting it away for any emergency that may arise
2570,5,i bought this before i realized how much i was getting and before i knew they had it at the grocery store that was my own fault i really should have waited but the seeds are great i just have way too many in my freezer
2571,4,i hope that this is really as nutritious as the claims  i chew on this like the romans and greeks and it gets stuck on my molarsbr br these seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice  go figurebr br i incorporated a  cup into the regular white loaf recipe from the breadbakers apprentice and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and i did not get much of a rise so i baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the bread rose to its usual height  since white bread is not that healthy i will include flax seed ground in my food processor to ameliorate the ill effects
2572,2,given the recent issues with products made in china i have decided to not buy any food products from there so i wont be buying anymore of this snack  if they ever switch to made in the us ill buy it again as i did like it
2573,1,this product is made in china  i would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegankosher  considering mrs mays markets itself as a healthy product i was shocked when i glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in china china has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices unsafe toys dog food and now were supposed to trust them making our health foodbr br not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world i will not buy this product anymore
2574,5,these are wonderfully crunchy and delicious the calorie count is misleading however one piece is more than the  calories they claim it is but its worth it
2575,5,if you like nuts and youre looking for a healthy great tasting snack you cant go wrong with almond crunch  my husband and i recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better  trying to find tasty snacks that dont contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find mrs mays naturals  we love the cashew crunch as well
2576,1,im a little shocked that this socalled health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients  id be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is  also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states  why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price  your purchasing choice does make a difference  lets stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy  they never will  we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical wellbeing make purchase decisions wisely
2577,5,the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying  
2578,5,ok i cant speak for when the last review was written which looks like  but im looking at the back of a bag of almond crunch and it clearly says that the product is made in california not china so if that was the main deterent back then its no longer an issue i just discovered this snack and as a person who cant eat either gluten soy or dairy i am thrilled to find a snack i can eat first of all and a snack i can eat that is actually tasty even better ive been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions and i have an extremely sensitive stomach i plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones i like the best but yeah id highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who arent
2579,5,im known to be nuts for nuts and ive tried nuts from around the world as friends bring them back for me as gifts very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is mrs mays almond crunch from the first time i tasted it to every time i eat it now i am amazed at the crunchiness quality of the almonds lightlysweetened glaze which is very unbrittlelike attention to healthiness in the ingredients etc as a side note because of how much i was impressed by this product i went on a tasting spree by buying about  different kinds of mrs mays products from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches etc perhaps im biased to the original but none of the others have that same magic i would rate the rest as  stars but the almond crunch should get  stars
2580,5,these are fresh crunchy natural and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car crumble into nonfat yogurt or over salads or pack some in the kids lunch convenient and delicious
2581,4,based on other amazon reviews i tried this product  the first shipment was great delicious  thought id found my new healthful snack nd shipment was a concern and disappointment  even thought of calling the company but i didnt  several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of   wasnt sure they were almonds  became concerned id chip a tooth so i havent ordered any more
2582,5,delicious healthy plus amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from mrs mays actual website
2583,4,love these snacks theyre a little bit sweet loads of crunchy almonds am looking forward to trying the other varieties too
2584,4,after reading some of the frothing reviews criticizing mrs mays for manufacturing their product in china  which doesnt in any way address the quality of the product itself  i tried to confirm this for myself the website and packaging say nothing about this so i wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured here is the response in fullbr br br br thank you for your purchase and inquiry we understand your concerns becausebr food item are very personal if you can spear a few moments to read detailsbr about our quality assurance it would be appreciatedbr br our factory in china is haccp hazard analysis and critical control pointbr by us agency  brc certified uk agency haccp brc  kosher inspect ourbr factory twice a year and each organization also performs random unannouncedbr inspection at our factorybr br please refer to the following sites if you like to learn more about thebr haccp and brc certificatebr br httpwwwidfahaccporgbr br httpwwwbrcorgukstandardsdefaultaspmainsectionidbr br in addition all of our finished products are tested  timesbr br these tests arebr salmonella testingbr aflotoxin testing andbr microbiological testingbr br our current customers like costco bjs wholesale and whole foods marketbr have very high standards on what they carry and sell to its members  youbr can rest assure that all of our products are safe to consume we also do notbr have any melamine in our product our products are dairy free our productsbr are also tested randomly by fda and always passed the inspectionbr br the following is additional informationbr br here are the origins of the ingredients that we usebr br almonds    californiabr walnuts    californiabr cashews    vietnam  brazil not grown in usbr cranberries   oregon  canadabr blueberries   oregon  canadabr pomegranate   oregon  canadabr natural flavors   californiabr sesame seeds    china not grown in usbr rice malt    chinabr cane juice    usbr sea salt    chinabr br please feel free to contact us with any further questions comments andbr concerns we hope we have assisted you correctlybr br thank youbr br kind regardsbr br juliebr mrs maysbr br br br ive read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops communism and carbon footprint to briefly address these there has been no evidence that mrs mays keeps its workers in sweatshops despite the communism im sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable and ships produce th the carbon per poundmile of trucks meaning a  miles by ship is as bad as  miles by truckbr br i really like the snack and id give it five stars but im subtracting one star i think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in china i dont have a problem with the snacks origin but mrs mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves granted most of us americans are primed to flip out at the latest scare of the week but that should be our choice to makebr br oh and the snack itself it is quite tasty filling and healthy i will continue to purchase it
2585,1,mrs mays should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand i wont be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are donoharm and qualitycontrol is a concept not understood in china totally frightening what theyre getting away with
2586,5,my husband has diabetes and has to watch what he eatsthis is a great and healthy treat for him  i couldnt find it at local stores and was happy to see it available on amazon
2587,5,there ought to be a recovery program but the good side is that a mrs mays addiction is healthy i already have a stack of boxes in the garage so i wont run out and here i am stockpiling more in case of nuclear holocaustbr br almonds have always been my staff of life  raw roasted dry roasted blanched flavored and of course mrs mays i rarely have a day without them i even feed them to the parrot a bird guy told me they were the healthiest and the bird goes nuts for mrs maysbr br these are dare i say miracle nuts one taste and i was hooked how she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle if youre tired of tastless bland gottaeatitbecauseitshealthy snacks from the nutrition store try these for a pleasant awakeningbr br mike
2588,5,we are typical americans who know we should eat better but often dont because health food is usually expensive and frankly doesnt taste that good  that is why we are so thankful to have found mrs mays products  they are all very healthy and quite tasty and ordering them from amazon keeps the cost down  my sons a golfer and i am always looking for portable healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag  mrs mays products fit the bill nicely
2589,5,my family and i love almond crunch theyre just sweet enough very crunchy and a perfect snack
2590,5,i have tryed the almond crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips try it youll agree
2591,5,this product is excellent its also a nut snack that my wife who has celiac disease and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy i however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack ive ever tried  al  virginia weatherly   luzerne dr macomb mi 
2592,1,i used to like this product until i learned that it is made in chinabr br how many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in china contaminated baby formula made in china contaminated tooth paste made in china and poisoned pet food before we learn that  if it comes from china it should not go in your mouth your babys mouth or your pets mouth
2593,5,this is by far the most delicious snack you could ever have  the almonds are super fresh and crunchy and the light coating of syrup is not too sweet  my whole family loves it
2594,5,my husband and both love almonds ive even shared this snack with coworkers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack  im taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip
2595,1,i used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips  these taste very crunchy and tastybr br given the kind of unethical food stories we read about china  we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these  you just cannot import food stuff and sell in the us as gourmet snack food  there needs to be data backing thisbr br few example of chinese food yuk br br  melaminekind of platic in baby food and milk so wide spread that  of milk in china contained this plastic in br br  honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin antibiotic  because of which it was banned in the usbr br  soy sauce made from human hair not joking google it if you wantbr br  spurious drugs exported to african countriesbr br need some good facts and quality controls from the manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls
2596,5,the negative reviews of mrs mays products just because it is made in china are not really valid cannot base on other companies poor quality control and apply to every company in the country  there are many bad quality foods that are made in the usa thats bad for your health so just because its labeled made in usa doesnt mean it is good quality  as long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales
2597,5,this is a great product  we tried it at the beach the first time and loved it  the cashew crunch was not as goodbr we bought a case of the almond this week  just great
2598,3,not real crazy but this product they did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties i made for the baby shower tables
2599,5,i am in love with this tea every other apple cinnamon tea ive tried has been too cinnamony this is the perfect blend it tastes like apple cider without all the sugar which i love i recommend this tea to anyone who wants a lowcal version of apple cider
2600,5,this is the perfect gift with a southwestern flair  the jellys were of decent size the spreader is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attachedbr br cute little bag  great gift for the price
2601,3,i thought it was okay but not harbanero bbq sauce from helli would probally not get it againalso it was not worth the money i thought it was kind of a ripoff it was  for barbque sauce you could have made at home
2602,5,montebello pasta has been made at the monastero di montebello in isolo del piana italy since  i love italian food but have severe digestive and allergic problems and their pasta is friendly to me and it tastes better than any other pasta i have eaten and thats a lot it is one of my favorite foods
2603,5,so i usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta  its usually all the same to me  however when i tried this brand of pasta i noticed that it does taste better  i cant describe how exactly but it does  i thought maybe it was my imagination maybe knowing its organic was influencing my judgment but my sister commented on it when i served it for her one day  she wanted to know where i got it  it tasted so good  hmmm  so while usually there isnt much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta for this brand there is  its subtle but its there  when we moved from california i discovered they didnt sell it in the stores here in ny  so i was elated when i found amazon carries it  elated over a simple pasta  yes thats how good it is in comparison  mmmmmm mmmmm
2604,5,best taste pasta cooks very well slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta nice color and mouthfeel just excellent
2605,5,i have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is  i buy in packages of  for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out
2606,4,good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me a little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though overall good coffee
2607,5,these are hard to find these days  product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty  we kept the box for about  year and the last pack tasted as good as the first
2608,5,gum made without sugar substitutes isnt easily obtained these days so i was happy to find chiclets through amazon prime  sugar substitutes present problems for persons sensitive to them so its good to have the option of gum made the oldfashioned way another source for this and other gum from yesteryear is vermont country store online however vcs sells the same box of chiclets for  so clearly amazon is a better deal  amazon prime free shipping makes it a much better dealbr br my greatgrandpa used to come home with chiclets from time to time so this gum isnt just loaded with longlasting peppermint flavor but longlasting happy memories as well  i guess you can say theres a lot packed into such a little piece of gum  hope you enjoy as much as i do
2609,5,i love drinking green tea  it is delicious hot or cold but being able to take it with me anywhere was key  so i searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the us  in the beginning what i found was either too expensive had sugar in it which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place or did not get very good reviews  then i found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping  i was pleasantly surprisedbr br the product works as advertised  it dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too  the instructions say to use one packet for  ounces of water but actually it should be used with  ounces of water otherwise it can be too bitterbr br it not only saves money but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that i need to recycle monthly
2610,5,the first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products if you do not want to read that part skip down to the bottom and there is the review of the stash teas onlybr br br br a couple of years ago i had a physical and my doctor told me that my triglycerides were high i was a serious soda drinker sometimes as many as  cans per day not diet so i decided i needed to start drinking something healthlier i gravitated toward green tea because i like it i averaged   liter bottles per day for  years i also averaged about  cans of soda per daybr br i recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down they doubled they were over  over  is considered high i about had a heart attack right there now i am not an overweight person and have had a fairly high motabolism but i have started to create a belly i call it a dr pepper belly because that is my favorite soda i do not drink alcohol of any kind i am telling all of this to you because all of my other tests came in within normal levels including all other aspects to my cholesterolbr br i did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products the excess sugar consumed in this case can be turned into trigylcerides i looked at what i was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me what i found shocked me the  liter bottles of green tea has more sugar in it than a can of soda i checked several different manufacturers of green tea and i found them all to have about the same amount of sugarbr br i concluded that between my morning coffee green tea bottles and soda i was consuming over  grams of sugar a week  or about  callories of sugar a week just in drinksbr br br br i was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products i personally do not have the time or patience to use tea bags so i was interested in the tea powders i ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it and i loved it i then proceeded to buy the other  flavors of the green tea powders and love them alsobr br there are  flavors that do not have sugar added so i use a few drops of stevia glycerite to sweeten the drink it does not take a lotbr br the best thing is that the tea powders cost about  or less than the bottled green teas i use to drinkbr br br br to end on a personal note i have altered my drinking habits and now drink  liter of the tea powder drink and  liter of water per day i still drink  can of dr pepper on the weekend but that is it i have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills i have lost about  lbs and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeksbr br i hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is
2611,4,i like the taste of this product but i have some suggestionsbr br  for strongest blueberry taste use less than the  ounces of water that the instructions indicate my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberrybr br  stir really well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway as well as for an oddly green i know its green tea but i rarely drink green things so it seemed a bit weird to me at first andbr br  if youre going to use a sweetener why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or splenda or etc i added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect but then i also like it without any sweetener at all as long as i use less waterbr br by the way this makes hot tea as well although its marketed as iced tea powderbr br enjoy
2612,5,i ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea  i wasnt certain how good it was going to be but i was pleasantly surprised  it tastes refreshing and fruity  the flavor isnt overpowering or fake  i mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda  the powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste  i was so impressed that i have signed up for automatic delivery  its a great product
2613,5,if you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder the instructions say to add one packet to  ounces of cold water but id recommend you try two packets and one packet  oz of stevia the flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor when you order this tea you will get six boxes with  packets in each if you use two packets per bottle of water you get  drinks that is only  cents per drink if you get free shipping  i ordered some books too i think that is fairly reasonable i look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices a website is given for additional recipes there are a few interesting recipes like the ones for white chocolate green tea ice cream green tea papaya nectar and green tea sugar cookies you will probably find many uses for this and ive even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea just use one packet per  ounces of hot water no brewing required this tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water i can highly recommend it to youbr br the rebecca review
2614,4,lots of uses for this green teabr br i generally like most tea though not the overally flowery blendsbr br being on more of a health kick in recent years i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or anotherbr from straight brewed tea lt hot or icedbr br to adding the powder to things like salad dressings smoothies baked goods etcbr br i am not new to green teaas i first started drinking it when living in japan some  years agobr in the ground form known as matchabr a quality product dissolves wellbr br i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened
2615,2,i expected the flavor to be more like that of brewed green tea it really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water although im sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants i wouldnt order this again
2616,5,ingredients listed pure cane sugar and  pure powdered japanese green teabr br nutrition facts all  except sodium mg and sugar gbr br basic instructions add one packet to oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolvebr br my opinion it is too sweet for my taste even diluted in a oz water bottle it almost tastes like sugar water i think the unsweetened version would be better  star because it delivers what it promisesbr br this is japanese green tea not chinese green tea there is a difference
2617,5,i keep this at work and i mix in my smoothies at home love it
2618,3,this tea is not so tasty in my opinion but one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree
2619,4,i make a jug of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day  im delighted to find a source in the us as it was introduced to me in bc  it does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy
2620,2,as others have said this is really mild in flavor  the instructions call for  packet per  oz of water  there are  packets per boxbr br i decided to give it a try as i am basically lazy and wanted some unsweetened unlemoned iced tea that i could make on a moments whimbr br i started with  packet per  oz of water then  packets per  oz of water and got some flavor  now im using  packets per  oz of water  i placed a fairly large order so i could experiment with it and have it throughout the fall and winterbr br since im using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor i will probably not order this item again
2621,1,i have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it i decided to try the stash brand instead of my normal japanese brand and its not even in the same universe the stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all seriously the stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it real authentic green tea powder is supposed to be  tea with no additivesbr br if you drink a lot of green tea you will be very disappointed with the stash product i strongly recommend you go with a japanese brand that contains  tea onlybr br i tried to return it to amazon but they dont allow grocery items to be returned
2622,5,this is good iced tea it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter
2623,5,this is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea i add lemon juice and stevia
2624,5,to get a more intense taste i mix two packets in a oz bpafree camelbak bottle adding  oz of water and the rest ice plus a packet of stevia shake well sip and oh so good nocalorie sweet tea green tea antioxidants and im drinking a lot more water i also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories although the stash rep tells me there is a negligible amount of caffeine the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout since i love mint i think ive found the perfect product
2625,4,this tea is more ginger than lemon so if you like the taste of soothing ginger youd like this product i mix two packages per  oz bpafree camelbak bottle filled with  oz of water and the rest ice and a packet of stevia shake well take sip ahhh  nocalorie sweet tea green tea antioxidant and great for summer i called the stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet and the rep said negligiblebr br i also buy the stash powdered mint green tea and i prefer the hint of mint better again if you are a ginger fan youd really enjoy this product
2626,5,i think this is a great green tea powder  i add this powder to a oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste i prefer it unsweeted so that i may add a sweetner if needed  great price for the quantity and the quality of the product
2627,5,i use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies  provides you all the health benefits of green tea  love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger
2628,5,i like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea  ive added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks  i have fun mixing it with things  it blends well for me
2629,4,this is a quick  easy way to make green tea it isnt sweet  only has the barest hint of blueberry but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning it does have more green tint to it than most teas heres why sencha green tea comes from the kyoto region of japan it is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea additionally the color of the tea is actually green not yellow like many chinese varieties powdered tea is also good for cooking as well
2630,5,i went on a diet last year and was looking for something goos to drink and came across this tes  now i cant find it anywhere hope amazon keeps this product forever
2631,2,what can i say i love iced tea i drink a lot of it and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have triedbr i purchased a case of all  varieties  when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my  ounces water bottlebr i finally found that i needed to dissolve  packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatablebr unfortunately by doing that to this flavor the ginger was out of control and not in a good ginger tea sort of waybr over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market
2632,4,i held off ordering these for a while because i was concerned i might not like the taste ive tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on i really wanted something powdered to take to work though so i gave it chance and it worked out  to me this product tastes great  i am thrilled to get something unsweetened  i wanted these to use at the office but find i like them so much i mix them up at home too i just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast  i went from thinking  boxes would be a lot to experiencing them as hardly enouughbr br basically this product has a mild taste never bitter or oily and not gritty but it will need to be remixed if you dont drink it down quickly  the powder does mix well its really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything  it blends completely into the water but it doesnt stay mixed over a long period of time  so if you are letting it sit in the glass about min or so as you sip away its useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along  that works for me no complaints  i am very happy with the product  i will order again
2633,3,i was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after i realized that the lipton brands all contained sucralose and did not come in an unsweetened version  i found stash tea online and decided to try it using stevia as the sweetener  i bought the lemon ginger flavorbr br by comparison i think the lipton powdered iced tea i had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity koolaid for adults  this is different  i am having to get used to the green tea taste and it upset my stomach a little when i drink hot tea i usually drink white tea because i like the mild tastebr br i tried using only half to a third of the packet in  ounces of water and that worked better  i would probably like white tea better but stash doesnt make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix  anyway i hope to get used to the taste  since right now i like it watereddown its really a good deal as far as price
2634,5,i wanted something easy tasty  and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction this did the trick i drank it for  days without adding any sweetener once you get past the color which is a nasty green the tea is tasty about a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste i will buy this again
2635,5,if you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beveragebr br i like the taste of green tea and i also like the health benefits of green tea  i mix this with ice water and splenda  it is a refreshing summer beverage  i like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages  it is convenient and easy to use
2636,5,this is just the quick iced tea fix i have been searching forit is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural refreshing blueberry flavor keep in mind this is not sweet and sassy like most instant tea add to bottled water packets this is the real deal if you want sweet then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener when you add the powder it is greenlooks alittle weird but once you can get past the looks its true love i think its delightful that i am actually consuming the entire leaffinely ground to which it disslovesthus making my water become murky swamp water before my eyes  that has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants opposed to the old brewing waybr   i have had a very difficult journey until now finding yummy healthy  quick unsweetened flavored teasmy second favorite is the celestial seasonings cool brew bagsthe blueberry green tea is also delicious but not nearly as refined as this top shelf stashbr i am pondering more flavors for my next order
2637,2,what can i say i love iced tea i drink a lot of it and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have triedbr i purchased a case of all  varieties  when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my  ounces water bottlebr i finally found that i needed to dissolve  packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatablebr over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market
2638,4,good flavor but not real sweet  i add a little stevia for my sweet tooth
2639,5,drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years then they changed production and began using sucralose which i dont tolerate wellbr tried several different teas before i found stashs instant green tea i like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice i can drink all i wantdont even need sweetener plus as i understand it its just made from dried pulverized green tea leavesno chemical process also its very coolby i get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription phil k
2640,2,i wanted desperately to love or even like this drink mix but am not having success doing so i love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me its too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it every once in a while ill try to tolerate a bottle again hoping i change my taste its not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people
2641,5,this ice tea is like heaven on ice  must try if you love lemon and giger  great price for the content  you can make a pitcher with  bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer  great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies
2642,5,this tea is awesome  you have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great  little prep time keeps me going all day
2643,5,this product is great i have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea so many of the teas are sweetened with splenda type sweeteners and i prefer to use stevia the jackie chan green tea appears to have been discontinuedbr br i mix this product and love the taste a little lemon and stevia and i have the perfect evening iced tea it provides all the benefits of green tea and the instant conveniencebr br i give it five stars
2644,5,this is the best iced green tea ive ever had the hint of blueberry is just perfect  i add a bit of stevia for a little more sweetness  it would be an insult to call this instant tea but i carry a packet in my purse because its better than any prepared tea i could buy when eating out  stash tea is always good but this is extraordinary
2645,3,when i received the package just earlier today i was excited to try it out immediately im already a loyal drinker of the yamamotoyama iced green tea powder and wanted to give stash a try particularly the mint flavor yamamotoyama only has three flavors original unsweetened sweetened and raspberry when i checked the ingredients of this product ground sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor i already expected that this would be unsweetened after all mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said natural i expected it unsweetenedbr br i do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a oz water bottle however i could sense a bit of the mint maybe it would be enough for an oz water content youd need to have at least  or  packets for you to have that strong mint flavorbr br but the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it well in this case it has natural peppermint in it is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats such as smoothies and even desserts just the other day i even added the yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my muesli hot cereal and it was delicious i plan to do the same with this stash mint green tea powder im an experimenting foodie so doesnt hurt to try lol with my hot cereal and milkbr br you can even substitute milk instead of water ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from starbucks and jamba juice before try it with this one 
2646,1,i wasted a little over  because the reviews were so goodbr this has no taste cold or hot it states to use oz of cold waterbr well i used just a cup and it didnt work out for mebr i tried adding more packets and it helped but very littlebr i am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolvebr that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cupbr of green tea or i am missing something herebr i do not recommend this tea
2647,2,what can i say i love iced tea i drink a lot of it and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have triedbr i purchased a case of all  varieties  when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my  ounces water bottlebr i finally found that i needed to dissolve  packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add the rest of the water just to make these palatable and only than were these passablebr over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market
2648,2,what can i say i love iced tea i drink a lot of it and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products or rather of all the other stash products i have triedbr i purchased a case of all  varieties  when i say i drink iced tea i am not kidding and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my  ounces water bottlebr i finally found that i needed to dissolve  packets in a small bit of hot water first if not the tea clumped on me and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatablebr over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market
2649,1,this tea is the most awful stuff ive ever put in my mouth  it has a chemical taste  i tried adding sugar and it didnt help i enjoy the arizona pomegranate gree tea and would highly recomment it
2650,3,this tea has an awfully light flavor i use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes very tasty i generally shake  ounces cold milk  packets of this tea powder and  ounce simple syrup then pour it over ice tho make the frappe i blend the same ingredients with ice instead of pouring it over ice it is annoying that to make a small drink i need to use  times more than expected
2651,3,ive had quite a few sencha powders in my time  the stash product is one of the bestpriced products out therebr br that said what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with  oz of water  i can barely taste the tea and im pretty sensitive to tea flavors  if you get this product keep your mixes at  oz of water  otherwise its like youre drinking a flavorless algaebr br otherwise its a good product at a good price  at proper concentrations the flavor is good and you cant beat the health benefits of a good senchagreen tea
2652,5,i first tried these powdered green teas from stash last summer this spring i wanted more but the store i got them from didnt think the vendor would be carrying any  i was delighted to find that i could get them from amazon i ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing real food drinks all summer in an easy to make form
2653,5,i finally finished my box of the blueberry green tea powder and wanted to try something new  so glad i tried this flavor as it is now my favorite  just add it to a cold bottle of water drink it as is or add a few drops of stevia or agave and you are good to go  very refreshing  will be packing this on my trip to mexico
2654,4,lots of uses for this green teabr br i generally like most tea though not the overally flowery blendsbr br being on more of a health kick in recent years i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or anotherbr from straight brewed tea lt hot or icedbr br to adding the powder to things like salad dressings smoothies baked goods etcbr br i am not new to green teaas i first started drinking it when living in japan some  years agobr in the ground form known as matchabr a quality product dissolves wellbr br i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened
2655,5,as a long time tea drinker was happy to come across this iced tea mix  it serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing  i find this iced tea very refreshing  i really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content  the plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry  the blueberry is good too its unsweetened so i add half a packet of truvia
2656,4,i really enjoy this tea because its not to sweet and its easy to use  i carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water depending upon my mood  i find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals a real great thing because i watch my calories  and of course green tea is full of antioxidants
2657,5,this is good iced tea  it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter
2658,5,i am hooked  this is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore  this powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners  it is just what i have been looking for  also try the blueberry version  delicious
2659,5,green tea is good for you loaded with antioxidants boosts your metabolism yadda yadda yadda but i never quite warmed up to the taste  until now  the lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor  and it is so great that i can just add a packet to my water bottle and go without the bother of brewing it
2660,5,just the right amount of blueberry flavor and the tea itself is not overwhelming i love that it has no added sweeteners and really does not need thembr this is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well
2661,5,i drink this delicious tea almost every day  i have yet to find anything like it on the market
2662,5,love this product  it adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners  hope this product is here to stay
2663,4,powdered green tea with lemon  ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags simply pour in water bottle shake and be on your waybr br product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on amazon
2664,4,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbsmjmstash premium green iced tea powder count packets pack of a easy to mix and refreshing with ice
2665,5,i was looking for mint green tea i could carry with me to mix up while out and about if thats what you want then this product is perfect i add a little extra water but thats just my taste so if youre looking for mint green tea powder    look no further
2666,5,this has a great rich taste remember this is ground whole leaf so the tea is stronger than you may expect  not overly sweet and dissolves readily  i use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a polar bottle
2667,5,i liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea  i use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge  very good cold and needs no sweetening as is lightly sweet already  doesnt look pretty but does look like a healthy drink  i liked it
2668,4,i purchased this item when it was on sale  i wasnt certain if id like it but ive read so much about the health benefits of green tea i wanted to try it  this is a nice pleasant beverage the flavor isnt too strong  i add a packet of splenda to make it a bit sweeter  the powder dissolves easily in cold water  the flavor is natural not fake  i was impressed enough with it that i have signed up for autodelivery
2669,1,the tea was very weak and not that good now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes
2670,5,love this  i dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that i could add to my ss water bottle gotta be good to the environment right  the flavor is great ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all  i can drink my green tea with or without sweetener  the only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long the calories will add up  i think each packet is  calories  i drink   oz bottles of water a day so that would be  calories of sweetened drink a day  but i will still give the product  stars because the product is fab  id just pick something else if im going to pound water all day long perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is not sweetened  its excellent as well  ill use this for one bottle and a nonsweetened one for the other  best of both worlds  enjoy
2671,5,i used to always go to jamba juice for the match green tea shotsafter trying this iced green tea powder i was hooked  this flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea  i dont mind the funny green colorafter all its green tea
2672,1,this iced tea is terrible this is the first stash product that i do not enjoy it is not iced tea it tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves
2673,1,the first ingredient in this mix before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin  if you suffer from a corn allergy please do not forget to read the label  unwittingly drink this  i have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product the tea itself  i realize this is not a review let alone a helpful review as i did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product i couldnt review this product if i wanted too  i want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea  i didnt know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews  i could not give the product more stars as it contains more maltodextrin than tea itself
2674,5,i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese they were sweet and gave us tea from japan my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it he smoked all his life and died at  anyway i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldnt feel as good as i did when drinking it i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig i really drank a lot of it  well i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you  times more antioxidants wow that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand i really love it i love that it is lightly sweetened i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler add ice and water and be on my way its just right but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being no getting around about it i dont get sick often for sure now i havent tried the other brands and i feel i dont have to because i am so satisfied with this one the price is also cheaper i dont think you can go wrong with this choice  perky
2675,5,love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time  tastes great i love this stash green tea
2676,1,i bought this tea as i like blueberries and stash is known as making good teas  however when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green not very appetizing  once i mixed the powder with water the resulting tea had no real flavor  i feel like i wasted my money and cant get a refund
2677,4,this is one of my favorite water addins i think it has a really crisp clean tastewith a hint of grassyness the tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle if left standing for more than a few minutes so i have to shake it up periodically there are times when i feel like im drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener it tastes great when i use stevia but when i use sweet  lowi get a bitterish grassy taste
2678,2,i bought this flavor and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent its uselessbr br if you plan on making a pitcher of tea forget it it takes  packs for  oz and is still very very weak in flavor and it must be consumed in  hours so they say so youre much better off brewing your ownbr br however if youre idea is to stash this in your purse for the ladies or pocket for men which would be weird its still misses the mark one packet does very little for flavor with  oz of water so youd have to use two and who drinks just  oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature also with only  to  packets in a box depends on flavor who knows why that gives you  to   oz drinks for  not sure its worth it at all id rather drink lemon water when out than this
2679,2,if you plan on making a pitcher of tea forget it it takes  packs for  oz and is still very very weak in flavor and it must be consumed in  hours so they say so youre much better off brewing your ownbr br however if youre idea is to stash this in your purse for the ladies or pocket for men which would be weird its still misses the mark one packet does very little for flavor with  oz of water so youd have to use two and who drinks just  oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature also with only  packets in a box that gives you   oz drinks for  not sure its worth it at all id rather drink lemon water when out than this
2680,2,if you plan on making a pitcher of tea forget it it takes  packs for  oz and is still very very weak and it must be consumed in  hours so they say so youre much better off brewing your ownbr br however if youre idea is to stash this in your purse for the ladies or pocket for men which would be weird its just okay  one packet does little for flavor with  oz of water so youd have to use two and who drinks just  oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature  also with only  packets the raspberry pom in a box that gives you   oz drinks for   not sure its worth it at all id rather drink lemon water when out than this equally as bland but free
2681,4,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbzghsstash premium mint green iced tea powder count packets pack of a light mint taste easy to mix powdered tea great on ice
2682,2,this was a big disappointment there was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this the color is green and not very appealing to look at however it does work as a great antioxidant
2683,1,i wish i had read the product description betteri didnt realize this was sweetenedi do not like the sweetened teasnow i am stuck with  orders of thembut the other green tea powder is great
2684,1,when i saw the mint iced tea powder on the website i thought i would like it but when  i received it and tried one i was very disappointed it was the green tea and not sweet at all the flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like i was expecting i had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that i like to be similar to regular iced tea i dont even know if ill be using the others i had received sorry about this but you did ask for my review on this
2685,5,what a lovely tea this is the rose petals are abundant in the mix and when you brew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips the full sweet scent of roses greets you this tea is perfectly blended and balanced its color is copperygolden very warm and luscious i just want to drink it every day for relaxation and sheer enjoyment
2686,2,upon opening the sealed bag i was struck by an unpleasant scent  looking at the ingredients i saw in addition to the black tea and rosebuds a natural flavor additive  i believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose  then i brewed this tea and could still taste that additive but overall the tea was tasty  i hope the davidson family reads our reviews because i am certain that if they would just refrain from adding the natural flavor i and others would find this tea to be superb and in keeping with the other teas i have come to enjoy from davidsons  for example upon opening their darjeeling loose tea as well as their assam loose tea my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet  this is what one wants to experience from superb teas  i will look forward to davidsons responding to my and other customers suggestion re this nasty flavor additive  ive enjoyed tea with rose petals while in india and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals
2687,1,this tea was horrible  it tasted like potpourri  i have really enjoyed other davidsons teasmany also containing flowers and thought to try something new  i think the last ingredient is where things went bad  it was natural flavor  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all
2688,2,when i ordered this tea i was so excited because i thought i had finally found the equal to another brands rose tea in individual bags i was excited for the loose quality of the tea along with the anticipated light delicate taste id hoped forbr i was sadly mistaken when i excitedly opened it i was hit by a very sweet syrupy cottoncandylike smell coming from the bag not a good scent then i thought the smell doesnt determine the taste so i steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste the overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea unfortunately i had to pour the rest of mine outbr i have a bag of hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company im really hoping its better
2689,5,this is my first exposure to rose tea i purchased it because of the previous review i have to concur this tea is delightful the aroma is fantastic and makes you believe you are in the midst of a blooming rose garden it is a perfect tea to sip in the winter months as it fills your senses with the scents of summer i bet it would be refreshing as an iced tea with a sprig of fresh mint too cold to try that now but once the snow melts i will great product for the price
2690,5,wow  i am a pepsiholic and was gaining weight as you can imagine a little  year old woman introduced me to your tea hot  and now with just a little bit of honey and ice i have a nice cool refreshing drink
2691,4,i am pleased the bag is so large it means ill be sipping this tea for a while  this tea is perfect for the start of the work day  the rose and hibiscus liven my senses the caffeine pushes me to type a bit faster as i climb over a hillock of emails  the flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends ive mixed on my own is the cause the mysterious natural flavor another reviewer pointed out but it is still quite pleasant  i certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose congou
2692,5,the fragrance of the tea totally blew me away recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant rosey scent
2693,4,i am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable  i dont think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea but since i can not get that one at this time i ordered this one and it is very good
2694,5,i bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it to see if i really liked it over timebr br i do  this tea is really lovely  the rose scent and taste are just right  not too lame not too overwhelming  i find it slightly calming even with the caffeine from the black tea  of the  or so loose teas in my drawer that i regularly use this is the one i seem to reach for most often  im diligent about brewing times  this one is  min and i set the timer  gives me a perfect cup every timebr br dont forget that its organic  support organic practices and do something beneficial for your bodybr br this tea was a good buy and has withstood the test of time for me
2695,5,good beans  i cant find these in the grocery stores where i live but ordered them through this retailer with no problems
2696,5,adzuki  or azuki beans are ment to be used in asian sweets you can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for  min changing the water out at least twice draining and mashing the beans with sugarstrain the paste if you do not like the bean skins  what you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream fill pasteries or stuff into mochi cakes
2697,5,their not only good for you but their yummythey smell like cloves when their cooking and taste  a little sweet
2698,5,good stuff  like lentils you dont need to soak these  they are small so feel good in the mouth
2699,5,i really like this flavoring i try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so i can add my own mostly liquid stevia  i also love vanilla flavoring in many things i make so i sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot for example i make my own almond milk so i like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste this works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste i also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good i put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking also with cookies i use this all the time and now i am not dropping  every couple of weeks for vanilla extract
2700,3,i wanted to love this but i just didnt despite being sugar free it has  calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes if your going for calorie count this isnt favorable i would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isnt overly important you should give it a go it may be just what you were looking for as a side note if calorie count is unimportant i recommend their coconut cream flavora hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbzujjamoretti premium coconut cream syrup mla its delicious
2701,1,we purchased from the original website  flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all it was expensive and not worth the money
2702,5,weve been eating this delightful cereal for several years  my kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do i  unlike the popular junky cereals this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and its a special treat for the kids  i also like supporting envirokids products  the pricing has come down to where its nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you
2703,5,we received this as a gift along with some homemade graham crackers  my husband and i have become addicted to it  if you love things like lemon meringue pie you will adore this lusciouslemony spread on grahams pound cake etc  just a thin layer of this delicious confection enlivens your taste buds with an explosion of flavor  i highly recommend this product if you are looking for a very special treat
2704,5,i have never tasted any better need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price
2705,5,mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon curd is a delicious easy quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests
2706,4,the popcorn itself is yummy just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper  the kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped  its great in the microwave or a pan but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper
2707,5,i wont claim to be a professional food taster  i just know what i like and dont like  i dont like yellow popcorn i dont like microwave popcorn i like the white popcorn cooked in a pan  for my popping style the baby white pops great wo lots of hard kernels  nuf said
2708,4,this is really good tender a little sweet easy to make in the whirley pop and excellent with some cheddar  spice popcorn seasoning
2709,4,i was a little concerned to buy the popcorn as you never know what you are going to get  but i did and i am glad i did  the popcorn is nice and tender pops easy great taste and hullless  i have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad i did because of this product  i like the fact the the popped corn is small but great
2710,1,i love the popcorn but the shipping costs are insane a total rip off wabash valley farms or amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind  stars for the popcorn minus  stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping arghyes the popcorn is tender and luscious and it melts in your mouth like youre eating cooked grasshoppers but come on cant you ship this product for lessbr br shipping the  pound bag is even worse sigh too bad really
2711,5,we like the much harder to find white popcorn over the more common yellow popcorn and amish country baby white is our absolute favorite  we usually order  of the  lb bags cause we go thru it so quickly
2712,5,i love this popcorn only downside is the shipping and packing cost almost as much as the popcorn need to pack it better bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door
2713,2,i purchased the baby white by accident  we usually get the medium white which is great  the baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it
2714,2,tasty small kernel popcorn however too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper the kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped
2715,3,the gourmet corn is smaller kernels than i like so would probably not buy it again  but with their special oil and the stir crazy popper every kernel pops every timebr br i will probably return to good old jolly time
2716,5,this is the best popcorn i have ever ate i use a whirley popper to pop my popcorn when you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn i gave my orville redenbachers  and walmart popcorn awayto many husks you just cant beat this popcorn it tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it
2717,5,i first had this popcorn at my  year old cousins home i thought it was so tender and delicious and i wanted to buy some for myself i found it on amazoncom believe it or not  anyway i ordered  pounds of it all  pounds are now gone this popcorn is really good it is different than other popcorns i have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate i consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because i have eaten it every night since i was a little girl i usually eat my popcorn  kernel at a time but since the kernels are so small i ate it by the handful my only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped i wish i could find it locally so i would not have to pay for the shipping costs if you like popcorn i highly recommend it
2718,5,over the years i have bought a lot of popcorn for popping and i have found this small baby white hulless to be the best for popping and not a lot of the socalled oldmaids i also had to retire my  plus year old wabash valley farms stovetop popper it was a good one so if you like popcorn and who doesnt this popcorn and popper combination is the best and the popper comes with a  year warranty as well money well spent you will not dissapointed with either of them so enjoy
2719,5,this is the best popcorn i have ever had  as a kid i ran the popcorn machine in a theater so i feel i know what im talking about  we used yellow popcorn but i still think white is best
2720,4,baby white popcorn from wabash farms pops nicely has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth and is very tasty what more could you ask from a popcorn i highly recommend this product at least a four star
2721,5,the small white popcorn is the best  very delicious  and ive tried lots
2722,5,this was the sweetest smallest hulless best tasting white popcorn i have ever had  just placed an additional order for a  lb bag as well as other varities carried by this company
2723,5,great popcorn good popping results and wonderful flavor  cant help but love it and i will reorder when i run out  recommend to one and all
2724,4,i love little white kernels of popped corn  this was good stuff but i think ill try a larger white kernel to pop next time my preference
2725,5,pops great in the microwave  much better than many store brands  good product
2726,3,i was disappointed  i thought being amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional  but its just popcorn no better than others ive purchased  so so i would not buy it again
2727,4,my doctor told me i must eat hulless popcorn if i have popcorn at all  because i cant give up my favorite snack i bought this wabash famnily farms amish country popcorn  the kernels are tiny but they pop well although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn i get from the grocery store  it tastes great however and has fewer and smaller hulls  i dont think there is such a thing as completely hullessbut ido notice thst i dont get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore
2728,4,i ordered  lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews i really like it but the real test was my wifes opinion and we also ordered  and  lbs of popcorn from the boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better we use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter i really like the cambrias cream kernels the best
2729,5,i just made some in my whirley pop  it really is lighter and crisper than the larger yellow kernels  none of those large hulls either  the only difference is it pops up much smaller than the yellow so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot  lovely homemade popcorn
2730,5,use olive oil to cook this salt it well and it is the best most tender popcorn i have ever eaten i add a tiny bit of butter to mine but dont need it my nine year old daughter didnt like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this after a few bites she consumed half the bowlbr br i bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in long grove il so i didnt have to pay shipping costs but when its gone i might have to bite the bullet and order it from here
2731,3,wish i would have read the reviews that discuss the products performance in hot air poppers  the pc is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth starsbr br problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop  tilting the machine helps keep them inside but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn
2732,4,weve enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the movie theater popcorn  its light and fluffy  tender  and delicious  i think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no palm oil or coconut oil in it  we can control what oils we add or leave out  it works well with the popper  in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other  we enjoyed this more
2733,2,popcorn has grear color white  but taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product i would not buy again
2734,5,i bought the whirleypop stovetop popcorn popper several months ago which of course the wabash valley popcorn came recommended same company i thoughtwhat the heck ive always wondered how gourmet popcorn differed from orville or other everyday popcorn brandsbr br let me tell youit is worth the extra money i can really taste the difference in quality and normal popcorn just doesnt taste right when you make it in the whirleypopbr br this popcorn is so tender and tasty it was a little weird to see and eat at first because its about half the size of regular popcorn but i believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the cornbr br my favorite prep methods include using the whirleypop and nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil see my review for that for more details i add a little peanut oil sea salt black pepper and a good amount of vegaline garlic mist cooking  seasoning spray yummybr br ive tried the other amish country popcorn and theyre all good this is my favorite though
2735,5,this popcorn is really great  we enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn  its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat  i eat only this popcorn now and order every three months highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world
2736,5,i bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn and put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on popcorn but it needed more popping for all to pop in fact almost twice as much time but the results are greatbr today we will get the seasoning i bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching tv
2737,1,this is  terrible popcorn no taste poor popping ratio and the size omg i popped this gourmet popping corn in front of a party everyone busted out in laughter
2738,1,do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor one cup of popcorn will have  cup of  un poped old mades kernels left over which is unacceptablethis is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck so i recommend staying away from this one
2739,3,this is my first time trying wabash valley farms amish country baby whitebr br pros its okay with a nice mild nutty flavor the hulls are more pronounced than with some other amish baby whitebr br cons it tends not to briskly pop up in fact weve burned several pans because popping it is tricky we found that the microwave often works better than pan popping and as mentioned above the hulls are much more noticeable than with other amish baby white brandsbr br we purchased these  bags and well use them up but wont be ordering any more next time well drive the long distance to our nearest amish store
2740,3,if you like your popped corn small this is for you taste is good and it is crisp yet tender the only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull
2741,5,popcorn is very good  cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story a very good purchase
2742,2,bought lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this baby white than on regular popcorn  not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn the corn pops up so tiny that its about  hull  popped corn per kernel i was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hullsbr i popped this using every tip i could find on the internet all experiments still resulted in a tough hull
2743,3,received the baby yellow instead of the correct baby white kernels unable to return the product since its a grocery item but amazoncom customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund as far as can tell no other issues with product
2744,4,i liked the idea of the small popcorn  it pops up really well in the popper but it doesnt have much if any popcorn flavor  was pretty bummed by that
2745,4,i used to grow the japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper this is the closest i can find if you are appalled by the shipping cost like i was try looking elsewhere for a better deal for instance one popular site offers  lbs for  with free shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments which you can cancel any time try wwwckingcom
2746,5,i have made this my popcorn of choice  i enjoy the flavor and kernal size
2747,5,get it get it get it this popcorn is truly the most tender delicious popcorn i have ever tasted
2748,5,got three different amish popcorns for my daughters birthdayshe is always on a diet i got her the hot air popper same timeshe  my grandson hes  loved itshe ate a bowl every night   still lost  lbs  not saying its a diet food just satisfiing 
2749,5,i bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends the have commented back several times that its the best popcorn they have ever had they love it  they had shopped in the dc metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on amazon was all it took to find this  the best popcorn ever
2750,5,i bought this for my daughters new microwave popcorn popper as a christmas gift and she says that it is delicious but pops up smaller than other popcorn  she likes it a lot
2751,5,this is very high qulity pop corn i recomend it  almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop  very healthy and yummy
2752,5,pops fully few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method  small fluffy kernels not a lot of misfires that are only partially evolved  my wife says theyre a tad too small for her taste but the kids and i really love this popcorn
2753,4,this popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version what a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again
2754,5,i love this brand  all kernels pop and they are a nice size texture and flavor
2755,5,i have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself it was part of a gift for my daughter in grad school  she likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls  also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until christmas  that remains to be seen without having to buy more  a very good snack for a poor grad student
2756,5,im a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts and the amish country brand popcorn is the best ive ever eaten  absolutely delicious
2757,5,there are very seldom any unpopped kernels which is nice and the flavor is wonderful not a whole lot to say about popcorn i always buy from you guys and will continue to
2758,5,i love white corn in all its forms including popcorn and i hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket so i love this popcorn
2759,5,i enjoy it practically every evening it is very good popcorn not as much hulls and small when popped
2760,5,this popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn and it is virtually hulless  that is exactly what i was looking for in a popcorn because my  year old loves popcorn  with  year old children you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums  my son has no trouble eating this popcorn  it is soft and light doesnt get stuck in your teeth nearly as much and has a great flavorbr br this is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family  i usually pop it in my  year old cheap hot air popper with no problems  i get very few unpopped kernels another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping but i have not experienced this problem it could depend on the popper i suppose  i have tried microwaving it in a paper bag but i always seem to end up burning it  i think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right so i just stick with my hot air popper i get great popcorn every time
2761,1,i am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale  i received  bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from wabash valley farms amish country gourmet  well the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls  it burns very easily  there are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel  i ended up throwing most of the popped corn away  i am so disappointed in this product  i now have  bags of this stuff  i have nothing good to say about it  but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product  i am giving mine to the squirrels
2762,5,i bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper and i made some as soon as i got them it is the best popcorn ive had i thought i would mind the smaller kernel size but i didnt there is substantially less hull than regular popcorn the flavor is great i suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn it gives popcorn a great nutty taste  really delicious you can buy peanut oil at any oriental asian store its better than olive oil olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me but peanut oil is perfect you wont need butter flavor or anything like that again artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals now we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood try it and youll be popping like us
2763,2,the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper ive had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time ive used the wabash corn shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn
2764,1,this popcorn has alot of hulls i order  bags and cant stand to eat it its so hully  terrible
2765,3,the popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper i used the whirley pop popcorn maker and used  tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper while the majority of the kernels popped there was also a large amount of seeds or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while youre eating i actually got better results using orville redenbacher white popcorn kernels in the whirley popper and it was actually cheaper at the local market overall i give amish country  out of  stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results
2766,1,i ordered this because amazon recommended it to go along with the redenbacker popcorn popper i got from them hey only a few of these actually pop most of these small unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper what an absolute waste of money
2767,3,this is good popcorn but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would
2768,1,worst popcorn ive ever bought  chewy not fluffy  gave it to the birds for bird food  postage was outrageous  just not a good experience all around  wont be buying from them ever again
2769,4,this is delicious popcorn  lost a star because i use a hot air popper and many of them  jump out before popping  great flavor great texture  tender  i do not add anything even though i have purchased three different flavored toppingsbr br thanks
2770,1,this baby white popcorn pops small and somewhat hard  i have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat using a whirlypop popcorn popper  unsatisfactory results  i wont purchase this again
2771,2,we loved this popcorn  but come on  shipping is way over the top  we would settle next time for something we can buy but not spend  times on shipping
2772,1,i can only go as low as  star on the review though id like to rate it a  this item still shows in stock but clearly isnt which is why my order was canceled from amazon today amazon suggested i search out the item again and in doing so i see that this same vendor states the item is available not sobr br technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product just the ability to be able to ship it good luck
2773,5,got this for like  on a warehouse deal it was a bargain i received them in early may and the label says best before june at a rate of one can per  days i dont think ill have a problem finishing them off before june i know i have a sweet tooth all  cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good they were just as described  soft cheese balls about  per can in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture
2774,4,why is this  when the same product is available for  herebr httpwwwamazoncomvictorflymagnetbaitrefilldpbrbdybr br the victor m and m traps are unreal of course  total fly genocide pretty stinky but only right nearby
2775,5,we have used the victor fly bait for  seasons  cant beat it  great product
2776,5,bar harbor clam chowder is absolutely fantasticbr br  i am not usually a fan of soup out of the canbr  i am really picky about my clam chowderbr br that said i get this stuff in bulk  there are several reasons for this the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes  second i like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and third that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup i like to use a mixture of milk and cream  the fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper  two things that ruin clam chowder for me  i know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but i really just want to taste the clams when i have a bowl of new england clam chowder  if youre like me in that respect then i think you will like this soup toobr br ps as a child i was a fan of friendlys clam chowder before they changed their recipe  bar harbor is even better
2777,5,ive definitely had a stigma against canned anything and still do picked this up at the supermarket drawn by the all natural ingredients for once no msg or really anything else i didnt recognize its really quite good and especially so for coming out of a can i can have excellent clam chowder  and with a little milk and butter exactly to my liking  warm within minutes one of the few canned goods i keep in my cabinet and one of the most convenient and surprisingly satisfying meals always  minutes awaybr highly recommended
2778,2,ive just prepared my first can of this soup  it tasted incredibly bland and didnt have much clam flavor  so then i added more milk butter onions salt and fresh ground pepper plus white wine  for  per  oz can all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already except for the pepper bar harbor brand certainly didnt stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams thats for sure  there were larger pieces of clams than in progressos  but thats damning with faint praise  next time ill buy the clams and make my own for less probably  im just perplexed by these reviews  i think i can safely say progressos tastes better  and of course its much less expensive
2779,4,this is our preferred clam chowder  we like the natural taste with lots of potatoes the only complaint is i think the soup can be creamier amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save
2780,2,im a little perplexed by all the great reviews  this was the most bland chowder ive ever had  i prepared it with just milk and a little butter and it tasted like nothing  added some salt and white pepper still nothing  added some black pepper and provence herbs now it tastes like herbed potato soupbr br on the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender  the consistency was pretty good too  it just had no flavor  not going to be buying this again certainly not when its this expensive too
2781,4,its not as good as i hoped but canned chowder never is i added some butter a can of chopped clams and some milk  then thickened it a bit it works great as a base but not for me straight out of the can

2783,3,ive had better canned clam chowder  bookbinders is one that comes to mind  i dont buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients so my choice is limited  for this one if i add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter along with some extra sea salt its ok  the longer it is gently heated  not simmered or boiled  to let the flavors mingle the better it becomes  more clams and potatoes would improve it  as it is the ingredients were skimpy
2784,5,this is the best clam chowder ever come originally where this is produced and was so happy when i found it on line keep this in my cupboard at all time being an old maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times
2785,5,the best canned clam chowder ive found currently available  very light nicely seasoned creamy taste  not fishy or oniony  good amount of minced clams per serving  to find better chowder it would have to be homemade
2786,1,bits of clam not sure in water with something i assume is potatoes whose recipe is this save your money get something worth having how do so many like this its awful if you prefer real clam chowder and not seawater with something floating in it do not buy this
2787,5,this is clearly the best canned clam chowder i have tasted it is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring the can is supposed to be condensed but if you like a hearty thick soup it is better just heated without adding milk or water the clams are perfect and not over cooked i will order again and look forward to trying out some of the other products they have on amazon
2788,2,my local store had the product lineon closeout at  cents a can so i bought a dozen cans of different verities lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the manhattan chowder was very watered down  the new england chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor  the clam corn chowder was not enjoyablebr br   i am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when i dine out  long story short this is the most tasteless soup and just not good  i suggest you pass on this and i am sure cambells will be a much better choice than these soups sorry i had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and  cents a can i would never buy this again
2789,2,i expected better from a premium maine chowder this is no better than say snows which you can get for less than half the price not bad but not worth the money
2790,1,we opened a can of bar harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder  there were mostly potatoes
2791,5,i used to be a buyer at a naturalorganic grocery  this is the best soup i have ever had in a can  i am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is the ritz carltons clam chowder  just add butter milkcream and black pepper  have some fresh corn bread and butter and you are in heaven
2792,4,for canned soup this is very good clam chowder  those who give it  or  stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup  i would buy this any day over other brands  you can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg salt and other nasty ingredients  pure and clean soup  those who rate it badly some say it has no flavor or there arent chunks in it  the flavor is mild but that is good not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup  if i want to next time i will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost its contents not a big deal to do  i would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that doesnt care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients  i will buy this again good source of iron as well
2793,4,even though the chowder is very very good as is  i add a can of the bar harbor chopped clams to it  along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of budda br br yummy 
2794,1,tried this yesterday as a treat on a cold rainy fall night  it had an unpleasant grainy and somewhat watery texture  the clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky for lack of a better term  the flavor was also very lackingit didnt really taste like well anything  definitely not worth the price  i can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for bar harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder
2795,3,we had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average  warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk andor butter to blend in with the soup mix we found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional even with as little as  cup of added whole milkbr br the package of six cans contained three dented cans  two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed  for this reason we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail
2796,3,i just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder and was disappointed to find or rather not find clams dont get me wrong  the soup was good with a very nice texture and taste but the clams were awol several times i bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor but only once did i find a clam fragment big enough to look at im going to buy some chopped clams to kind of chum a bit this of course increases the cost of the meal im going to try some other brands as wellbr br i do hope that bar harbor does some testing the label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient but i dont see how that can be  my money is on the potatos
2797,5,i adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like msg and partiallyhydrogenated oil most importantly this chowder tastes mouthwatering good and is bursting with flavor i use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes if you have not already definitely give it a try
2798,5,unless youve got a clam roller somewhere on your property i doubt seriously that you could whipup a better bowl of chowder the clams were tender fresh plentiful and remarkably nongritty the taters were tasty and not overly done i would recommend that they cutback a bit on the tapioca starch and add some medium cream instead  i like to add some diced vidalya onion or red bell pepper stir in some milk butter and black pepper and youre on your way to a delightful meal
2799,3,but still not that great its bland even when i added salt pepper milk and butter it didnt taste like the best ive had but at least its edible unlike every other canned clam chowder out there if i can find a way to make this taste better than id love it its the best canned clam chowder ive ever had but its not that great the clams taste goodbr br edit i had a nd can and i made it today i added only a little bit of milk and i added no salt pepper or butter and it actually tastes a lot better than when i did so i suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup its still not the best ive ever had though
2800,4,this soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great partially hydrogenated vegetable oils soycottonseed dehydrated potatoes modified starches of all kinds hydrolyzed corn gluten msg potassium chloride sodium phosphate disodium inosinate disodium guanylate and succinic acid what good is a classic new england clam chowder without these classic ingredientsbr br instead the first ingredient listed is clams next youll be telling me its got butter in it it does ohbr br on a more serious note bar harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder the first list of ingredients came from snows and campbells condensed new england clam chowders this bar harbor stuff is worth it
2801,3,i was really excited to try clam chowder from maine but it did not wow me  i think campbells might even be better
2802,5,good flavor and not too richfewer fat calories than the standard fare its not loaded up with canola oil like campbells and progresso so you can add a little quality evoo like california olive ranch or even butter for a healthier brew if you prefer it that way like we do i also add a little half and half and saute some hormel bacon bits with red onion and garlic to add complexity to the flavor i was impressed i usually also add some gortons wild pacific salmon frozen in most markets to basically make it a healthy fish chowder
2803,1,one perfect box no rips tears or gouges inside the box  badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane every single can very disappointed should i return them all is the chowder any good was this a joke i rate this  starfor the unblemished box
2804,4,very good clam chowdernot as good as being in maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders
2805,5,bar harbor clam chowder is an excellent product easy to fix and has tremendous flavor nice amount of clams and potatoes you will enjoy this product very well 
2806,4,this arrived earlier than expected which was great however for some reason this particular product smelled a little like fish food but no worries still tasted like great cashew butter just the smell was kinda weird  like fish food also i wish this product was organic
2807,2,when i first started to use iams savory sauce my dogs loved it after a few weeks they dont seem to care too much for it anymore they still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while and will eventually eat it when they are hungry but they dont consider it to be a treat anymore i still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced and low calorie one big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and aroundthemouth stains i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins so if your must have some sort of gravy i recommend vitagravy a bit more or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues but a great free solution for picky eaters
2808,3,our dog loves this stuff i bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food i thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then but this stuff stinks really bad like dirt it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house if they could improve the smell of it that would be awesome because our dog just loves it but we cant bare the smell of it
2809,5,my dog likes the iams savory sauce  it helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off and its good for him
2810,1,i ordered this pack of  pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal wellbr br st its not lbs of tea i received only br br nd its not high quality full leaf tea but rather the ground tea leaves youd expect from liptonbr br strangely enough i ordered the nondecaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesnt taste half bad if someone receives something different than i or rather if someone receives what was advertised id like to know about it maybe ill try again
2811,1,this was the nd time that i ordered the smokehouse usa chicken stix the st order had usa printed right on the bag this one had a usa sticker over the china sticker  in addition the product looked entirely different obviously i am concerned i pay more to ensure i am not feeding my fur kids products from china if it happens again ill stop ordering all smokehouse products online
2812,5,i had read another review and the reviewer was concerned about this product coming from china  i called the manufacturer and was told this product is made here in the us  my dog loves them
2813,5,this is a new treat for our kids they are pretty picky eaters especially my girl they both love em glad i found this product reasonably priced too
2814,5,i have a german breed gsheph  he is very very picky he loved them he is such a happy camper he wakes up in the morning  ready to go for his walks  comes home straight to his treat cabinet he wants his chicken stixthank you finally something that my boy loves
2815,3,with the prime shipping this made a great last minute gift it seems a little pricey for the amount of fish but the quality was good according to the person i gave it to in the end i think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar
2816,3,i think pack of  for  is too much  per box i got them in target for less than  sometimes also maybe because of promotion i got them for  or around that at safeway i will not buy this one online taste is five stars but price is one star
2817,4,i eat a lot of cereal and that includes a lot of the highfiber kinds oatmeal mini frosted shredded wheat and raisin bran are usually what id eat when i needed to lose a few lbs but there have been a few instances where i tried the healthier options ive tried several of the kashi cereals but they werent very appetizing the plain one had a cardboard taste next i tried grape nuts which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food though its closer to kitty litter in texture that brings me to fiberplus antioxidantsbr br this berry yogurt crunch is certainly one of the better tasting highfiber cereals ive eaten its like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal the clusters of yogurt really help but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own yes there are g of sugar per serving but the g of fiber and  calorie parts more than make up for it especially if you compare it to raisin bran and frosted shredded wheat which are typically higher in sugar and calories yet lower in dietary fiber the antioxidants are a nice bonus toobr br the bottom line is that ill add this to my grocery list whenever its on sale or the price is right
2818,5,let me first say that i dont eat cereal as a general rule  i just dont like it  i dont drink milk ever so eating dry cereal isnt always a treat  i purchased a box of this for my husband  i ended up trying some because it just looked so pretty in the bowland i was hooked  this cereal is tasty and healthy and i eat it everyday now with my yogurt  i cant give it enough stars
2819,5,i am now on my third box of this delicious cereal i try to eat only high fiber cereals mainly for nutrition but also because they seem to be more filling this is now my favorite if you purchase the fiber plus bars many times they have a  coupon on the back off one box of cereal  i buy mine from wal mart  and use coupongreat deal usually lasts me a weeki eat a bowl everyday  also many times youll find a  coupon on cereal box for fiber bars they are pretty good too especially the chocolate almond
2820,5,my daughter living and working in dc this summer introduced me to this product while home for a visit  she encouraged me to give the plain version just pure coconut water a chance first and by the second container i understood the amazing qualities of this drink  i felt so refreshed hydrated and healthy  i later tried the kind with pineapple which is also delicious but i think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot tired and thirsty while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail  cant wait for 
2821,5,this has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones ive tried they use real fruit juice for flavoring as well as it tastes goodbr br we tried the smaller size and they just arent large enough to get enough water at the gym and are not resealablebr br things i like about thisbr br  perfect size for an hour long gym routinebr  resealable capsmaller one lacks thisbr  tasty like a pina coladabr br negativebr br  box makes it hard to get the last drops usually end up squishing it up to get the last bitbr br so great coconut water perfect size and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the amazons subscribe and save
2822,4,i like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water good well chilled coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink
2823,4,love this juice scheduled shipment is convenient and economical this is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it is worth it
2824,5,i have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry and this is by far my favorite  the pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa i also like the tetra pack with the screw on top it is much more convenient than the smaller  oz size which you cannot reseal  this has been a great gatorade substitute for me and helps a lot when i am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly great stuff
2825,5,shipping great and loved product the boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish  i suggest buy only little ones this way
2826,5,i discovered vita coco a few months ago  of the flavors i have tried i like the pineapple best  it tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol  i love the idea of an allnatural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium  whenever i am hot thirsty or a little rundown i find that vita coco coconut water with pineapple really quenches my thirst refreshes me and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes  an ounce serving  has only  calories and  mg of sodium less than fatfree milk with  mg of potassium and  of the rda of vitamin c  its a little pricey but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping its a great value  although i have previously purchased it on amazon i more recently bought it at gnc during gold card week when there was a free shipping offer and a buy  get  free offer  with a deal like that it breaks down to less than  cents per oz serving
2827,5,pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of vita coco it not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage aka the perfect hangover cure but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum 
2828,4,i really like this coconut water but i was surprised that per oz box its the same price at wegmans  probably wont be ordering again unless theres some sort of discount
2829,5,heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it had one while traveling and loved it i sat on the plane enjoying iti was thinking i should bought another one
2830,3,i subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that its changing from  oz to  oz  but no price change  wow thats a really lame cut to increase their profit margins  whatever i wont miss the  oz obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers
2831,5,i tasted the pineapple flavor yesterday at a friends cocktail party she used it to mix with rum to make pina coladas it complimented the drink so well the bottles are really pretty to set up and hand out at a party as well br br i have been drinking vita coco for a while now and usually drink the  pure but i find the flavors to be such a treat yet still very healthy especially after a long workout
2832,4,its highquality and the price is right especially with subscribeandsave via prime but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription i had to put it on hold  im not a big water drinker but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when youre using it as a workout beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you  or me at least id still recommend it just dont od the way i did
2833,5,originally i was turned of by this product when i tasted the regular flavor once i had the version with pineapples i was instantly hooked i used to get a lot of stomach cramps and cramps in my feet since i have incorporated this drink daily it has aided my digestive system and obliterated all of my previous cramp problems i would recommend vita coco to all of my friends and family
2834,5,of all the flavors vita coco produces the pineapple combination is by far the best  it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering
2835,5,the pineapple coconut combination is refreshing i especially like that there is no added sugar this is a welcomed change from other brands
2836,5,i like this product so much i have it delivered monthly  so happy to be drinking this at work while my coworkers are stuck with pop  its so refreshing and revitalizing  the only coconut water flavor i like is pineapple  transports easily and stores easily with the screwon top
2837,5,i always feel refreshed when i drink this coconut water the pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible it has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year
2838,5,i tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best  light but refreshing  i am not sure if i think it is a miracle elixer or anything but i did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis  thank you for the great value and convenience amazon
2839,5,i use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultrameal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste greati have it for breakfast every morning
2840,2,this product doesnt have the greatest taste i like jamba coconut water but its hard product to find i purchased this to try out and im not liking it but its tolerable when its cold really cold reason why i gave it two stars  i tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough they were right
2841,5,if you havent had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this simply delicious and so healthy for you
2842,5,bigger is always better and that is not what she said i did  i got turned on to coconut water about a year ago and since then have not been able to get enough of it  i found that vita coco is the best brand around  the pineapple flavor has a great sweetness that compliments the coconut water to create a refreshing thirst quenching beverage  i have recently began to drink more due to the nature of my job so i dont cramp up in my hands plus with all the nutrients and benefits whats there not too like with subscribe and save  i can quench my thirst any time of year  thanks vita coco you surely have a lovely bunch of coconuts
2843,5,i love the taste of the viva coco with pineapple if i was likening it to a common drink its a melted virgin pina coladabr the  oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes because they contain the resealable lids in case you dont drink it all at oncebr as with all coconut waters the taste can vary slightly but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant
2844,5,good thirst quencher milky and thicker then i expected not what i would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple
2845,5,i love the pineapplecoconut water it is high in potassium i am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather in the afternoon i get hot dry and thirsty i am trying to lose weight so im watching my calories water is wet and cold but doesnt quench my thirst this stuff does the trick it quenches my thirst and gives me a little pickup for the afternoon and keeps me going this only has  calories per serving so that is much less than a  calorie gatorade i recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks
2846,5,i love the pineapple the best had a hard time finding this at the storethey get ya hooked and then stop carring iti have tried the other brands of coconut water but im just not loving themso i went online hoping to find this brand and there it wasnow moms happy and so is everyone else  love the vita coco
2847,5,short and brief  the product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet  i will certainly purchase this again
2848,4,ive always wanted to like coconut water  low in calories high in minerals  but ive just never liked the taste much the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference it still needs to be well chilled to be good but it makes a healthy postworkout drink
2849,5,i love buying these and drinking them after my workout  you lose not just fluids but mineralsvitamins and this helps replenish you  water is good too for you too but i just love these postworkout  they are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink like you dont want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing
2850,5,after reading about the benefits of coconut water i decided to give this brand a try  i have tried a few other brands with a juice added but they all have lot of extra sodium  be sure to read the labels  some have less potassium in them than the via coco brand  i felt like this was better for my husband to drink than gatorade he works on ac during the summer and is out in the heat all day long
2851,5,love the pineapple flavor makes me feel like i am on vacation drinking a pina colada you probably could add a little rum andreally tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters i have tried
2852,5,this product is a good addition to fruit smoothies  it thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes which are good during the very hot weather
2853,5,i love this water i started buying it after my bikram yoga classes to rehydrate and now drink it whenever i feel a little dehydrated  living in az i tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too  try them youll be hooked 
2854,5,vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie it is great for rehydration after a workout and has more potassium than a banana
2855,5,it says on the box each drink contains the potasium of  bananas  more electrolites than a sports drink they might seem a little high priced but go to groecery store buy  bananas   sports drinks and you will pay more to get the same nutrition you get from  juice box of this coconut water
2856,5,great before during and after a workout great natural electrolytes very high in potassium amazing drink this is my favorite flavor tangerine is nd
2857,5,great real coconut young coconut taste not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks  good on the environment made in brazil even better  you can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
2858,5,not only does vita coco have the best taste much better than onebr and slightly better than zito but now they have the best packagebr alsobr br this new screw top is great to take to the gym hiking and bikingbr br coc water is the best rehyrator and imo vita coco is the bestbr i also noticed when i searched coconut water on amazoncom thatbr vita coco comes up number one so others seem to think that vitabr coco is number one also because they are voting with thier purchases
2859,1,according to an article on cnncom on  the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lablebr researchers at consumerlabcom tested the sodium potassium magnesium and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water and they found that only one zico natural contained the stated amount for all four ingredientsbr br the sugar and potassium content in the other two brands vita coco and one also matched the label but the amounts of sodium and magnesiumtwo nutrients key to hydrationwere as much as  and  lower respectively than the listed amount
2860,1,i bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because i see it everywhere it was nasty i will never drink this crap again i dont care how good it is for you the taste is disgusting and id rather just drink regular water blah
2861,5,im so addicted to these you know the movie when harry met sally when i drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie orgasmic
2862,1,this stuff is pretty disgusting  i dont care if madonna tom cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps it tastes bad  and as far as rehydrating better than water umm dont think so  it might replenish potassium although unless you are participating in the olympics you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity
2863,2,i had hoped that this would taste like pina coladas but it doesnt  it is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue  i wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow  the reason i gave it  stars is because it is good in mixed drinks  i have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol  if you are going to drink this straight it helps if it is really coldalmost frozen  if you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing i can taste in it
2864,2,the product description says  packs of   count but when you order you only get a box of twelve  i did this weeks ago talked to amazon but they still havent updated the product description
2865,5,high quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bagsbr organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives therefore they must be properly stored all coca tea  air tight bags are resealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry cool dark place away from strongflavored foods  an extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one monthbr do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside many fruits and vegetables especially if they have been damaged give off ethylene gas as they ripen coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas the refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties allowing it to build up to damaging levels although not hazardous to humans the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea
2866,5,i got a bag with  oinkies pig skin with sweet potato in the middle  but my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received  its still made by hartz  the description of this product didnt say anything about sweet potato in the center  so unless they update the description  package image i got the wrong product  im only happy because my doggies are p
2867,5,these are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken my  pound sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her i highly recommend these for any dog especially one with food allergies
2868,5,i have an old english sheepdog he absolutely loved the treats it took him longer than i thought it would to eat through one so i could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his it was great
2869,1,when i placed my order it was for hartz pigskin  pack with sweet potato center  when i received the order it was hartz pigskin  packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew  i contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or spca  they were also very fast in sending out the original product  they told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that
2870,5,my dog craves theseone each morning shes never had digestive problems with them unlike the beef rawhide bones which we wont give her we couldnt find them suddenly in any of the stores and i was soooo delighted amazon had them right to my door quick  thank you amazon
2871,1,i emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato and they assured me that theyd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center  however the ones i received did not and i feel like i was lied to by customer service because they didnt want to take the time to actually check into it
2872,5,wrigleys  flare sugarless gum is wrigleys sugarless replacement for their big red cinnamon gum  flare seems to be difficult to find in stores thanks to amazon i always have a supply  flare is also the longest lasting gum i have ever experienced both in flavor and durability it is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market
2873,5,i love this gum  it is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find  i was hooked on the cinnamon extra until that went away  now this item is not available  this world needs more cinnamon lovers
2874,5,i tried this gum after trident cinnamon became hard to find a couple of years ago  trident told me that they were overhauling the plant that made the gum so it was in short supply but it would be back  i quickly discovered that the flare  was far superior to the trident and i havent looked back  it does last a long long long time  unfortunatley as other reviewers noted it has become very hard to find in stores  trident cinnamon is everywhere but now i dont want it  amazon saves the day again
2875,4,i found this coffee flavorful and bold  i didnt experience bitternessbr br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americanobr br my favorite kcups arebr starbucks french roastbr starbucks caffe veronabr starbucks pike place roastbr green mountain xtra bold sumatran reservebr green mountain double black diamondbr green mountain revvbr green mountain dark magicbr br other kcups ive tried  coffee people jet fuel green mountain dark magic decaf emeril jazzed up decaf starbucks caffe verona coffee people black tiger  starbucks house blend starbucks breakfast blend starbucks sumatra wolfgang puck french roast green mountain lake and lodge green mountain french roast caribou mahogony wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya emeril big easy bold
2876,5,is so good lots of flavor and great coffee taste especially good to wake up with enjoy this coffee i give it a plus 
2877,5,i love how fast my cups arrived i will always get my k cups here i cant wait to try something new
2878,4,we have several of these machines at work and ive tried lots of different flavors and blendsthis is one of the few i can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder  lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong  this one is actually very tasty
2879,5,ive tried a handful of other brands of french roast and i find this one and tullys version to be both great and comparable in flavor the difference is the price this one is far more reasonable
2880,4,i have had green mountain coffee before but had not tried the french roast  i am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers even with the same types of roasts  the green mountain french roast has the flavor i like and was expecting  the price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly  my only disappointment was in the shipping packaging  i knew that i was ordering  boxes of kcups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was  there was room for  boxes with the extra space filled with bubblewrap which seems wasteful to me  but on the whole i am very happy with my coffee
2881,4,this coffee has a nice bold flavor not too strong but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable  if you like a distinctive medium bold cup of coffee you will love this
2882,5,one of the best choices so far  if you like bold coffee you will like this one  will definitely buy again
2883,4,i prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong  it works well for me  the way he made it work for him he makes a cup and a half and that suits him  it also makes the kcup last twice as long
2884,4,out of curiosity i compared with sidebyside with tullys french roast kcups  these green mountain kcups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of tullys  both kcups are good but if youre going after a french roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then id recommend tullys french roast kcups
2885,5,french roast my green mountain is my favorite every day kcup its a good coffee bold yet smooth not burnt i hate peets and starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans if you like the nasty burnt taste these probably are not for you if you want a well balanced bold smooth everyday coffee these kcups will work
2886,5,this is great french roast for whatever reason it is also cheaper in count than the other green mountain coffee roasts
2887,5,i find many kcups are weak and not what i am used to starbucks but this french roast is a pretty good subsitute to the  coffee i get from the store
2888,1,if you love super dark rich bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for youwith one problem  personally i love coffee that embodies everything i just said  i love esspresso and the like  to find a kcup that is this bold even on the  oz setting is greatbut there is that problem againbr br it smells tastes and leaves the after taste of burnt urine  like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee then packaged it yumbr br there are other dark bold kcups out there that have a better smell flavor and does not have a nasty after taste you may not believe me and that is fine but get a sample pack before going for the  youll thank me later try the green mountain coffee extra bold sumatran reserve kcups better all around cup of coffee
2889,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbfzwsplanters peanut butter cookie crisps  calorie packs count boxes pack of a  these cookies are so tasty  i love the peanut taste and the crispness  a onehundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on  probably the most important part of weight control is portion controlbr br the cookies have  grams fat  mg cholesterol and  weight watchers points
2890,3,its very nice that the company put  calories packages outgreat marketing idea  they taste okay to me  a bit subtle on the chocolate ihmo  mostly theyre lightlyflavored chocolate wheat crackers  they have very little nutritional value but over  sugar  the  calories is achieved by a very light productit doesnt weigh much  so  calories sounds greatbut only if you eat but one package  not easy to do if youre hungry  still its a convenient snack to put in a backpack lunch box carryon now that they dont feed you much when you fly etc with less calories than most alternatives  could also tide you over between meals  still id personally prefer something a bit healthier  but thats why theres chocolate  vanillaoops they left out the vanilla
2891,5,i enjoy them a lot and so does my son i have to say that this kind is one of my favorites it is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only  cals as for the amount you get in the bag it is more than i expecting so i was very happy
2892,4,i enjoy the peanut butter cookie crisp but they are definitely a departure from the originals  still my son loves them so for this reason i still give it four stars
2893,5,one reviewer writes that these are oreo crackers without the cremeand they are right these thin oreo crisp wafer type cookies by nabisco are easy to pack for when youre on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion they also make for snacking anytime of the dayor nightand they give you that great oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredientbr br these crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat freehooray  there are only  calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat they are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy french fries these crackers somehow manage to give you the full oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories too excellentbr br these oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy this makes them even more portable for both children and adults another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been premeasured to contain only  calories this way you cant accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to havebr br i notice that these crackers are made with cocoa please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to thatbr br i recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack they should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy they make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat andor cholesterolbr br buy some and enjoy them today  smiles
2894,5,i really like these  they are so light and airy almost like chips instead of cookies  the flavor is that yummy oreo chocolate we all know and love
2895,4,these are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo i purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy in my opinion these tasted like animal crackers i will stick to chips ahoy  calorie packs
2896,5,i have been eating the  calorie chip ahoy for sometime i really find that it is a filling guiltfree snack it has a unique taste of its own  not a diet foodtype taste either it taste like a real snack
2897,4,as i get older and fatter i seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy  oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods  however oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief  not only are oreo cookies delicious but i sometimes think i hear oreo cookies calling my name as i walk by them  honest  i am unable to buy oreo cookies because if i do i know i will eat them generally in a few days  not a good ideabr br nabisco realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods have created a brandidentified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker  to this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie  however this wafer snack which nabisco has decided not to call a cookie perhaps because cookie sounds fattening is reasonably yummy  i have eaten these things several times and still eat them  i actually eat them more than regular oreos which i count as quite a nod to healthbr br you may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie  if you are going to add the fat and calories in icing perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular oreo cookies  in fact just revel in the calories and go for the double stuff oreosbr br oreos have been around since  and remain the bestselling cookie brand in history  according to our friends at kraft which owns nabisco and which is owned by the altria group renamed from philip morris presumably for marketing reasons more then  billion oreo cookies were sold in the first  years of their existence  though oreo thin crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the oreo namebr br of course you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy but where is the fun in that  for those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system oreo thin crisps are a lovely alternative  or course you probably should avoid eating pounds of these even with the reduced fat  food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you even if it tastes good  at least oreo thin crisps do not talk to me when i walk bybr br enjoy
2898,4,we are still six years away from the centennial for the oreo cookie which was first manufactured by nabisco in  as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the english tend to use it was copyrighted as the oreo biscuit  the sandwich cookie was quite similar to the hydrox cookie produced by sunshine but oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making hydrox back in  what would be considered the modern oreo cookie was developed in  originally they were mound shaped which is why some think the name comes from the greek word for hill with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the cream in betweenbr br of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition oreo cookie  there are oreos with chocolateflavored cream instead of the traditional white as well as orange colored cream at halloween and red at christmas  you can get oreos with a double portion of filling not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling carmel and chocolate coffee and cream peanut butter and chocolate etc  you want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge  they have that or with white chocolate fudge in winter and then there is the uhoh oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversedbr br but what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating  after all once they are open they could go stale and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness  nabisco has taken a threeprong approach for weight watching oreo lovers  you can go with the reduced fat oreo which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving  then there are the mini oreos bitesized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays  now we can add to that short list the oreo thin crispsbr br these are baked chocolate sixsided wafer snacks almost  to a pack that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream  now i am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer so i was wary because i thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream but they are lighter in taste than that even without having the glass of milk handy that i considered essentially when eating the more traditional oreo cookies  since they do have the oreo taste i can round up on these  these come in  calorie packs to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake  you can six  oz g packs in a  oz box  each pack contains  grams of transfat  grams of fat and  milligrams of cholesterol  you will also find one of  healthy living tips on the front of the pack eg  make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees  of course i was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit
2899,3,with any low fat or low calorie food youre going to sacrifice taste of portion size  with this product you sacrifice bothbr br its a good idea which was done well with the oreos and others in this series of  calorie snacks but i think youre better off with a single cookie from the regular chips ahoy box than a whole bag of these
2900,5,love this snackbr its really tastybr filling for my wife not me thoughill take  please 
2901,5,how good these cookies really are  theyre delicious satisfying and really really healthy  definitely a great alternative to real cookies
2902,4,first thoughts brings back old memoriesbr br when i recently tried these little wafers i recalled when i worked in an office nearly  years ago whenever the director skipped lunch he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till  oclock he usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer i came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him  i guess they really admired him these nabisco oreo thin crisps baked chocolate wafer snacks would have served his purposes much better than the saltines but i would rather he have more of his old favoritesbr br in a nutshell nice for a dieter at coffee break time  but no cream  sugar pleasebr br basically this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something inbetween meals and they dont want it to be a  calorie confection thats why the biggest print on the label says  calorie packs   inches acrossbr br whats this stuff all about enriched flour  sugar  artificial flavors  artificial colors  a little canola oilbr br  grams of fat   grams of sugar in a  gram package   caloriesbr br bottom line no pretenses  simple lean sugar wafer with the usual additivesbr br as diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you one can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and bloodsugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack for that purpose this is a great product and i know that our director  years ago would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon when the director didnt find any saltines around the office hed head straight for mcdonalds and the rest was history
2903,4,i hate to admit i miss the lard i was the one in your thgrade class who unscrewed the oreo ate all the white middle licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers thats the image i have of this cookie even barbra streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of a star is born the oreos because she had two backup singers who were black thats why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on mebr br it is a single nickelsized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute dont get me wrong as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as lowcalorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lipsmacking satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are  calorie packs a fine idea for weight watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight its just that i dont feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack
2904,5,nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh  lbs die an early death and no longer be able to give nabisco moneybr br kidding aside these are loveable the texture is perfection if you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth
2905,2,i was sorely disappointed in these cookies they are pretty tasteless and damn hard too i wouldnt buy them again and ive certainly tasted much better lowcal cookies i definitely recommend saving your money folks
2906,5,when you have a craving for a sweet but you dont wont too much this bar is just perfect  its yummy
2907,5,i dont usually like really crispy cookies but the taste of these changed my mind  i like that you get quite a few for only  calories  i often go for quantity over quality so i would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie
2908,5,these are our favorite indulgence at  calories for a sweet fix and energy they are the best  sad to see on amazon they are no longer available br quick shipping and they arrived safely
2909,5,these cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack  my  yrold granddaughter likes to say the letterbr before she pops it in her mouth
2910,5,these  calorie cakesters are delicious  both the vanillabr and the chocolate are great they satisfy those little sweetbr cravings and its only  calories for three little cakes
2911,4,let me begin by saying that i do not like oreo cookies at all i think the cookie part is bitter and i hate the white cream filling when a friend suggested i try these i was reluctant and kept telling her that i was not interested she insisted so i tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all im diabetic so this is not a snack i will be eating often but a few here and there wont hurt if youre expecting these to taste like oreo cookies im one whos glad they didnt then youll be disappointed but if you want a chocolate snack thats low in calories and fat please give these a try
2912,4,growing up on oreos and milk is common so i was taken aback with the brand extension of oreos to cakesters and while i had low expectations i must say these are better than normal oreos although i cant say itll beat the combo of oreos and milk these are fantastic treats and relatively guiltfree  if you like cake and like oreos you cant go wrong with oreo cakestersbr br the filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new oreo experience certainly worth a try  guaranteed enjoyment
2913,5,i have recently joined jenny craig as  i need to lose some weight and these  calorie pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks  i appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably i have agreed to take a shipment each month
2914,5,i loved the original oreo cakesters when they first debuted but i shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving so when i saw the commercial for the  calorie version i could hardly wait to try them and i must say i am very impressedbr br while some of the  calorie snack cakes can have a dry mealy consistency these cakes are moist decadent and taste  like the originalsjust smaller i would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version but is watching calories good job nabisco
2915,5,my family is on the last box  my oldest daughter ate most of the cookies  she likes peanut butter more than anything and these calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great
2916,4,these are more like a cracker  good for a little fill in for between meals
2917,2,chips ahoy cookies were not very tasty  my children and husband would not eat them  i tried to give them away and everyone refused
2918,5,super yummy really hits the spot when i want a chocolatey snack that wont break the calorie bank
2919,5,such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks  the arrived quickly  so easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack
2920,5,i absolutely love the oreo thin crisps cookies a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbfzwioreo thin crisps  calorie packs count boxes pack of a they taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet
2921,5,of all the calorie pack snack products ive tried and there have been many these are my absolute favorites the funny thing is that i dont even like oreos and am not that crazy about chocolate however these thin crisps are exactly that thin and crisp they are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger
2922,5,they melt in your mouth  i think i found my perfect snackbr i love oreos but hate all the fat they provide to my diet  by diet i mean the ability to eat everything in moderation  i monitor how much fat i ingest for many reasons health being the most important  one package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only  of the fatbr i also like the fact that they come in individual packages  they dont go stale  you can take them on trips movies park etcbr great tea or coffee cookies too and of course good old milk
2923,4,i hate to admit i miss the lard i was the one in your thgrade class who unscrewed the oreo ate all the white middle licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers thats the image i have of this cookie even barbra streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbayelaa star is borna the oreos because she had two backup singers who were black thats why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on mebr br it is a single nickelsized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute dont get me wrong as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as lowcalorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lipsmacking satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are  calorie packs a fine idea for weight watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight its just that i dont feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack
2924,4,dude these things are pretty good as long as youre not bent on them being just like oreos i mean theyre not but i definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams the lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies like peanut butter cream cheese icing pudding melted chocolate
2925,5,these are great snacks for traveling such as by airplane or car  the cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker  the cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble and for this reason a preferred treatbr br the texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat  the first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is humm these are good  this is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time
2926,3,sorry but i wasnt terribly impressed by these light snack crackers okay i admit that i never liked oreos that much in the first place this  calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like oreos for sureminus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling but as one other reviewer noted theyre not all that chocolaty a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic worse than that theyre not so good for you if youre going to have  calories there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly  percent to sugar for my money a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense it not only costs less its got lots more nutritional value not to mention fibre
2927,5,who doesnt love oreo cookies  many of us well remember after school snacks of oreo cookies and milk  however also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past  so its a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find oreo thin crispsbr br  no i was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting i just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals theyre crispy crunchy chocolate wafers  a wonderful comfort snackbr br  a high five for oreo thin crispsbr br    gail cooke
2928,5,i was one of fifty families chosen to receive nabisco oreo mini cakesters for free to do a product review on  once i received my nabisco oreo mini cakesters in the mail i and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediatelybr br the box of nabisco oreo mini cakesters comes with five individual packages  each package is  calories  in fact the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are advertised as being  calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved  each  calorie package comes with three oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirtythree and one third caloriesbr br the appearance of the nabisco oreo mini cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness  they are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly  when you put a nabisco oreo mini cakesters into your mouth they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor  in fact they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake  the nabisco oreo mini cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isnt as easily tasted or rather it wasnt possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but i didnt have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsonsbr br my oldest grandson ate almost two  calories packs of the nabisco oreo mini cakesters minus one or approximately  calories  he enjoyed eating them and even gave nabisco oreo mini cakesters his lick of approval to the wrapper they came inbr br my youngest grandson isnt able to communicate effectively verbally hes special needs but i considered his dedication to eating his nabisco oreo mini cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his  calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately  caloriesbr br i definitely give the nabisco oreo mini cakesters a thumbs up  i believe that i really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two  calorie packs or  calories worth of nabisco oreo mini cakesters that i ate i honestly didnt mean to eat both  calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so i ate it  but luckily i know that all i had was  calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at allbr br i like the fact that the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are presented as a  calorie pack  i found the thought comforting especially since i ate two packages of them  i even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too  i am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me  i think the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you dont want to overindulgebr br if i have any complaint about the nabisco oreo mini cakesters it would be that they are too small  but since that is actually part of their appeal i dont consider their small size a problembr br i do recommend nabisco oreo mini cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you
2929,5,i love oreos but hate the filling  these prevent me from having to scape the filling out and theyre good for you  calorie wise
2930,1,these things are nothing like oreosyou think wow oreos think again i would say spend your money on something better the hersheys or reeses crisp wafer bars come to mind my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer or milk bones
2931,1,to be honest with you i got these at a store you think wow chocolate chips and oreos think againfor those that think these are so good i would recommend the hersheys or reeses crisp wafer bars my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer or milk bones
2932,1,these things are low cal oreos minus the creme minus the cookie the title oreo is basically a total misnomer these are nothing but black crackers with some sugar if that is what you want then click purchase
2933,4,these arrived in the middle of may and they have an expiration date of the first week of july this means i have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks just beware if youre planning on stocking up for the futurethe future will get here very soon with thesebr br its also interesting that the box inside the amazon box says for internal use only im not sure what thats about
2934,5,they all taste really good it comes in mango strawberry and red bean they are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time there are  of each flavor as well when i finish this canister i plan on buying another 
2935,2,well when i bought this itemi thought it would be a direct japan import  it is taiwanesebr it was bought at costco and resoldthe price label was still the productbr br the product can be bought at costco for half the priceif not lessbr br the expiration date was not printed on the productwhich makes me think it was expiredbr i believe this as most of the mochi is dry and toughbr br will shy away from this product
2936,4,you can find the sogo sweet rice mochi at costco now just bucks stha hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtrwesogo sweet rice cakes japanese style mochi assorted flavor cannistera
2937,5,i got this after a mention in the ny times and immediately became an addict  its a little hot but not too much and it has an amazing depth of flavor  a lot more than the plain version  i use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings  a little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes instead of sour cream is also great
2938,5,my aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available however she has absoloutely no problems with this not once in all the months ive been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way not to mention shes acting healthier and seems stronger on this brandbr br and she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable she clearly likes the tastebr br all in all i highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat
2939,5,i dont know why science diet is being referred to as junk food as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market a lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be but regardless my veterinarian wanted me to put my  year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine after some comparisons science diet mature adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food both my cats the younger one and the older  are on this food and they seem to enjoy it they both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them my younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy 
2940,1,this comes in a case of  so i bought one can locally before ordering the large amount  good move  i have  cats and none of them would eat it this review is for the mature gourmet beef entree havent tried the other favors yet
2941,1,i feed hills science diet to my pet because i love him and the vet tells me i should but in all honesty this product has what is quite certainly the worst snaplock reseal that i have ever encountered it is painfully difficult to get it to close properly and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the productbr br packaging is important it is no better for your pet to live on stale oxidized food than it would be for you oxidized fats are also called rancid if you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human well you get the idea this is about more than just inconveniencebr br i am posting this review for all the hills science diet products with this kind of packaging if you have had the same experience as me with this product please take the time to let this company know about itbr br i love my animal i want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him but this quite literally the worst reseal that i have ever had the misfortune to encounterbr br theo
2942,1,this review will make me sound really stupid but whatever i dont really care as long as people find out whats real and can avoid my mistakesbr br i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap i have had cats around me my entire life for about twentyfive years now my mother always just fed them whatever the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket  friskies nine lives kit  kaboodle stuff like that and our cats were always fine at least in terms of their eating habits they would eat in the morning stop when they were done come back and eat some more when they got hungrybr br my housemate at the time was working for hills and assured me that this was the best food ever made so great so on and so forth i now know that she is an utter buffoon but i initially trusted her judgment which is so unfortunate because she doesnt think she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags which made it a much more attractive choicebr br i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl but that didnt work as she would devour it in one sitting so then i took to measuring it and she did the same thing then i started parsing it out to twice a day that didnt work either because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day running around intentionally destroying things deliberately spilling her water crying etc until she got more food so then i split it into three servings same thing then it got to be four servings that was a little better but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times so then it went back to three all the while i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than  of a cup because she was a little chubby reducing was hell she became even more hungry but i figured she would get used to it not reallybr br for over a year she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way knocking things off my desk ripping up any paper she could find scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief as soon as she got food she was back to her sweet self but only for three or four hoursbr br we thought she was bored we thought she was a little nutty and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder she always wanted food it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sadbr br a few weeks back we took her to a new good nonmoney factory vet for her second checkup since ive had her i talked with him about her being always hungry he asked what she ate and i told him the adult indoor science diet without saying as much he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients science diet does in a very loose byproduct kind of way  ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning not that i care about spending money on the bean but this food is way too expensive for what it isbr br so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago she is still eating  percent science diet with  percent wellness you really shouldnt just give a cat different food one day out of the blue but she never freaks out anymore its amazing and its  percent because she is eating real food now along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her we have her down to eating twice a day only  cup in total she was eating three times a day  of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning walks away eats some more a few hours later and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over no more trashing dads papers on the desk no more howling no more deliberately spilled water on the floor its incrediblebr br i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no she was genuinely hungry because she wasnt eating any real foodbr br do your cat a favor  buy her or him so food made with real ingredients things you would eat  wellness halo innova evo whatever figure it out for yourself but please dont feed your cat this its garbage
2943,5,this is the perfect food for my cat  in fact the only one she will eat  wet or dry
2944,1,we have five cats  one an elderly cat of  years the other four in the  year range  the oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease  his numbers didnt warrant being on prescription food yet but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food  because we have five cats and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older catsbr br since we made the switch  weeks ago all of the cats have gained weight  this was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight not good for the rest of them  our other male went from a slightly chunky  lbs to an obese  lbs  almost three pounds in  weeks  the  females gained between  to  pounds each  we noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl like they couldnt seem to get full  we also saw a lessening of coat quality  lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly including with a furminator and one developed bad dandruff  the stools developed a really bad odor although i do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which i am grateful for  most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsenedbr br i am very disgusted with science diet  they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags one of the sites i researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available  if you compare the various science diet formulae that have different health claims on them  the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two  basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive  with other brands such as innova or royal canin there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulaebr br now to deal with the weight gain as well as the other problems we noted we are switching foods again  this time we are trying royal canin indoor mature  wish us luck
2945,2,although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced  the cans say it is minced but it isnt it is ground beef  my cat only likes minced  not chunks not ground  although she will eat ground cat food sometimes it has to be inviting and delicious yet she just walks away from thisbr br i hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product  the shipping was speedy and the value is great as long as they deliver what the promise now i am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all
2946,3,i ordered this because it is science diet and it says it is minced well it is not minced and my cats do not like it it is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they cant eat it i am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too will not be buying it again returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so i would be losing money

2949,1,i made the mistake of believing that science diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use after doing some research i realized that science diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or iams i would not recommend any of these optionsbr br the main ingredients are chicken byproduct and corn here are some interesting facts cats cant digest cornin fact they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition when i fed my cat the science diet he ate all the time constantly after switching him over to castor and pollux indoor cat formula he eats much less nowbr br also byproduct means just thatbeaks feathers toenail clippings meat not suitable for human consumption dead animals etc  totally not worth the  its cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself doesnt sound so appealing does it science diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find dont let your vet fool you either vets usually get a  cut from hills to sell you their cat foodbr br my recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research try brands like newmans own or castor and pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track recordbr br i later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals science diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers a requirement is to exclusively feed science diet to the animalsbr br try this instead a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbbcubzcastor  pollux ultramix indoor feline fomula dry cat food pound baga
2950,3,this food is working well for my   yearoldcat with kidney problems  but i cant find any info on how many cans are included for this price  im guessing  cans based on shipping weight and the price but i wont buy without better info
2951,5,a friend brought a bag of this tea back from a trip to taiwan and shared it with his coworkers i was amazed when i drank my first cup the best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery its a wonderful clear and elegant tasting tea ive never had anything like it and cant wait for it to become available everyone he shared it with wants to buy some a japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea please offer it soon
2952,2,sent this as a gift and found out later that many items were stale  they loved the thought though and loved the way it looked
2953,5,best coffee i have ever tastedbr br my wife neighbors and friends are all crazy over jamaican me crazybr br you must try it
2954,5,i love coffee anytime of day but sensibly i drink decaffienated coffee during afternoon and evening hours and a flavored coffee is a real treat but some can be overpowering this jamaican me crazy flavor not only suits my personalityha it is very pleasing to the palate the flavoring is very subtle while allowing the full flavor of the coffee to be enjoyed and oh the aroma is delicious both while grinding the beans and brewing the coffee i will definitely purchase this again
2955,4,i was looking for a wheel you know like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant i wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives pepperoni and some prosciutto  all for a new years eve party well it was not a wheel  thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at  pounds for the half wheel  pounds would have been way too much the flavor was excellent just enough of bite  the creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance i broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces it was all well received with the choices of red wine there was more than enough which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks i am looking forward to ordering this again  super bowl is right around the corner it is big so make sure you can carry and store this quantity as far as cost i thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere the cost per pound may be average but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor
2956,5,absolutely delicious  have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
2957,1,i did not know anything about chutney until i went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar i thought chutney was a different form of marmalade but i was wrong
2958,5,i have started the extraction process less than a month ago and so far it looks and smell wonderful waiting to try iti have put  oz in  liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful i plan on using the other  oz in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc
2959,5,wifey bought these for me for christmas  i used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work  after he left i wanted to try it myself  these were great  minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done they taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could  i might shell some of them and try honey roasting too  i see a lot of people boil them what are boiled peanuts like  you dont see them up here in ri and ive never tried them
2960,5,same great taste as the honeybush tea bags but so much more green  thank you for packaging this in bulk
2961,5,we use this in place of sugar for almost everything  it has a light flavor sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor  the best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index
2962,5,i was truly amazed at how great this product is the flavor is everything that you can expect from a sweetner that is this pure i will be ordering it again and i will try the other flavors as well
2963,5,buy these cookies you will not regret itbr br they are hands down the best storebought chocolate cookies out there and i buy every new brand that comes out from mrs fields to all the permuatations offerred by pepperidge farmsbr br these are much better than entenmanns recent incarnation of new recipe chocolate chip cookies the milk chocolate chip and soft baked chocolate chip cookies both of these newer cookie species are awful the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy storebought soft cookies out therebr br in contrast entenmanns original recipe chocolate cookie is a mindblowing experience delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouthwatering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste they seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookiesbr br i have absolutely no idea why entenmanns decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands it seems to have happened when the entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company so it was probably a moneysaving opportunity the original recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredientsbr br the only problem is they are so hard to find thank goodness they are now on amazon
2964,1,i received this box with great anticipation since they dont sell these on the west coast i got the package opened the box and was extremely disappointed the cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs and there was a rodent sized hole on the side of the box so needless to say i will not not be reordering these again
2965,5,i found wild thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products  the lemon salad refresher is my favorite salad dressing it is light now cal and very tasty excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices yum their customer service is excellent and helpful and the site shares some great recipes as well im a fan
2966,2,the shipping was very fast but so was the expiration date got it on feb   expiration is april   only  weeks before it expires  who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time  i should have returned it but who wants to go through all the trouble  well i stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable  thats what you get when you order food online  i will not order it again
2967,5,i have purchased these though a local source for four dollars for a pack of eight if you are not sensitive to msg then these are a delicious alternative to other salty snacks the seasoning is tasty and the thin sheets of seaweed are lite and crispy i eat them two or three packs at a time calories per love them
2968,1,i was disappointed when i received this shipment as the seaweed contains msg and its not listed as an ingredientbr amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase
2969,5,my little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappointbr other brands are too oily or salty or not enough  this one though is just rightbr i would be buying it again and again
2970,5,great for sushi or for use with korean kimbob or maybe just as a snack lightly salted great crunch and will support rice beef pork even fishbr or a vegetable or two
2971,5,i found this stuff to be very tasty great with jasmine rice or just as a snack i dont mind a little msg if it enhances the flavor
2972,5,this coffee was really good  been trying to find it in new york but havent been able to  i think its worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered  ive ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic  also i think the caffeine content is pretty high as im more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands
2973,1,my local walmart and target both have this ground or whole bean at a regular price of less than  per  oz bag its way overpriced herebr br it is an excellent coffee  im drinking it as i write this an interesting hint of woody creamy citrusy taste thats dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts
2974,5,this is my familys favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix this brand is moist tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes  people are used to namaste products are the best in my opinion of whats available out there in health food stores try it you wont be disappointed
2975,3,i ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix  it is a heavy cake and is brown that said it comes in handy to make streusel coffee cake upside down cake and other augmented recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the heaviness isnt a problem  plain cake though was disappointing  so get creative instead
2976,2,i made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix  they were just ok  they were dense but not overly so  so that wasnt too bad the flavor however is where i was disappointed  the vanilla flavor was so subtle that i missed it entirely and i felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness which probably would have also made them a bit more moist the child i made them for only ate a few bites
2977,1,i tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both  they had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange  i threw both items away
2978,5,i added  tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of alum  free baking powder and  coconut oil for oil  and it came out soo good my son loved it  i liked it too the fact that its all the major allergens free makes it better
2979,5,excellent for gf  not bad on its own but i have used it as a basis for coconut cake pineapple upside down cake tres leches cake and others
2980,5,i think namaste gluten free spice cake mix is their best but vanilla cake is pretty goodtoo i especially like it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce with a dash of ground orange peel in my oventhe mix bakes better in muffin cups or a muffin pan than in a rectangular pan
2981,4,ive made these twice in cupcake form topped with red jam and powdered sugar of course it doesnt taste like a normal vanilla cake more grainy in texture with a subtle sweetness and some  spicebr but i think they are super tasty they didnt suffer from the weird chewy texture i often run into with riceflour based mixes also used energ egg replacer with no problem
2982,4,i used this mix to make a x cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil spring water and free range eggs  i thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what i was expecting  i was craving a white cake like wedding cake and went to my local store to find something wheatfree glutenfree and dairyfree i purchased this vanilla cake mix  i think it is a very good mix  i couldnt really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor  the cake is yellow dense but not like a pound cake and texturey like brown rice has more texture than white rice  i thought the sweetness was just right  i think i would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it
2983,5,this mix allowed my little one to have cupcakes at his second birthday party  they turned out great and with some homemade vanilla icing they were a hit with everyone  i even used ener gs egg replacer to replace the multiple eggs the mix calls for  one hint bake for almost the maximum time on the directions  they come out golden brown and moist
2984,1,the chocolate cake is fantastic so i had reason to think that this would be as well  not the case  it was very dense  tasteless  totally unlike the airy tasty chocolatebr i want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix
2985,5,this tea is hard to find  it was a joy to find it on amazonbr br large package  full size boxes arrive all for enjoymentbr br sugar plum is a delicious sweet warm feel good tea reminding you of christmas it has that spice palate of warm hibiscus barley rosehips i think what i like most of all is the sweet aromatic taste one of those tastes that makes you feel taken care of  a special treat when you are little like when mom or dad would make you hot coco or something you like that was so sweet and rare and only on those special occationsbr br i adore this tea and rather drink anyother teabr i am so happy to have found it
2986,5,this tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea the taste is also pretty good i make mine very concentratedbr with less than  ounces of hot  water and i cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thingbr and let it sit for as long as i can before i drink it
2987,5,this tea smells and tastes like christmas this has always been my familys favorite tea for childrens and big kids tea parties
2988,5,i began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year for the past two years i was unable to locate it in my local stores so i was elated to find it at amazon it tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me i love it
2989,5,so glad to have found this teaits my absolute holiday favorite  thanks for the fast shipping too
2990,4,br br celestial seasonings sugar plum spice is a delightful holiday tea it contains hibiscus roasted barley malt roasted chicory root rosehips chamomile flowers natural plum flavor with other natural flavors ginger root roasted carob and cardamom it does not contain caffeine so its technically an herbal teabr br celestial seasonings has been around a long time and makes quality teas all of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings all are certified kosher and none use irradiated botanicals which i appreciate although they use natural flavors in their teas these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits spices and herbs and never contain monosodium glutamate msg they use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing to remove the caffeine from green and black teas they use a process called effervescent decaffeination using carbon dioxide celestial seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teasbr br on the package celestial seasonings writes take a sip of sugar plum spice and journey with us to the land of the sweets in tchaikovskys the nutcracker here youll find gingerbread houses trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine this is the land of the sugar plum fairy who is beautiful gentle and kind we created this tea to pay tribute to her sugar plum spice is made with  natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice with just a hint of sweetness this tea is slightly sweet and full bodied tasting just as you would expect from the description the cardamom and ginger give it a little zing each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and i only need to use one at a timebr br i recommend it even if its not a holiday its perfect for a cold or wet winter daybr br 
2991,5,its hard to rate tea its very good tea but tea nonetheless however the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with they shipped the tea very quickly ill most likely buy from them again when the need arises
2992,5,the fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well ie none arrived broken  the cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese and not the modern version
2993,5,my daughters kindergarten class celebrated chinese new year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies  this company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success  her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the kindergartens
2994,5,i brought these cookies as a dish to pass at my family christmas get together they were a hit the cookies were fresh and unbroken packaging was well done and delivery was prompt my sisters had fun with the fortunes by adding the phrase while in bed after reading each fortunebr br i will use the amazon vendor house of rice again
2995,4,the cookies were kind of stail but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies werent broken
2996,4,my primary reason for ordering was the picture had shown the cookies as green i will acknowledge that the important information heading listed a warning that the actual product may be different compared to what was shown aside from the color problem they were shipped quickly and properly only one or two broken cookies on arrival but its no big deal i eat a few when they come in anyway im not sure what flavor they are but they are delicious as per the description if youre not picky on color good value
2997,5,the cookie is crispy good and flavorful  the fortunes are thoughtful not the shallow ones we are seeing latelybe patient even in time an egg will walk  i received the quantity and quality i ordered
2998,2,i was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong  i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all so disappointed i now have to go out n find the normal size cookies what a  waste of money i also needed  but  of them were broken they do not put fragile on the box outside
2999,5,i ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a multiplication test to go along with the theme fortunately we know our math facts  the majority of the cookies arrived still in tact  i understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few broken cookies  i am very please with the product and the customer service  i will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure i refer my family and friends to this business
3000,1,reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes i served them with a chinese christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed as were my guests  three sample fortunes are  life is not a struggle  its a wiggle  management is doing things right leadership is doing the right things  if youre feeling down try throwing yourself into your work  these are not fortunes they are selfhelp minibites  a fortune is  your love of travel will soon be satisfied and it doesnt matter if they are predictive or not  what matters is that they state a fortune  beware the dog in the corner house would be fun to get  life is a wiggle is boringbr the cookies arrived on schedule as promised and in good condition in their individual wrappers  all of that was as id hoped  but content counts in fortune cookies especially
3001,5,i am very pleased with this product i almost did not buy them because they looked green on my computer but when i received them they were the normal tan color that most of them are
3002,5,this is the second time i have ordered this product  i was happy enough the first time to place an order again  cookies were fine and delivery was very quick thank you
3003,5,well packed few are broken but it is understandable the cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting my friends and i really enjoyed it thx
3004,5,great product fast shipmentthe food product tasted great none of the fortune cookies where opened  i would buy again from this seller
3005,5,i bought these as a gift for my sister i was so excited to see that they arrived in great condition my sister loved them
3006,4,these cookies were a big hit at our progressive new years eve dinner  everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house they really kept the party moving
3007,4,this is a great product however you can buy it in a salumeria in brooklyn ny for   frank  sal on th avenuebrooklyn and im editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name liar liar animals i was only stating a fact about what a ripoff the site is  in the future amazonn please dont call me a liar thats not nice you stupid thieves
3008,5,bought as a christmas present smells like a milk shake i might have to try it might make a coffee drinker out of me
3009,5,amazing my roommate brought this home because it was on sale and at first i just gave it a shrug within a week i was adding it to every combination of bread peanutbutter muffins sauces meats i had in my kitchen guiltily apologizing to my roommate as i scooped and slathered away anything i added it to even if it seemed strange was immediately transformed into something wonderfully delicious even sweetening my tea and coffee with it had me in bliss needless to say the jar was emptied quickly i went back to the store to try stock up but they were all sold out and i havent been able to find anything like it since please mackays bring your deliciousness back i have a long life ahead of me and ive only just discovered you
3010,4,i bought this for my sister for christmasshe loved it but was afraid shed eat all of it at once so she took the box to work  within  hour it was finished by all her interns
3011,3,this tastes just like wintogreen life savers its a hard sweet crunchy ring with a minty flavor that pretty much describes it its a crunchy mint shaped like a ring
3012,3,this is good popcorn i have purchased before in hawaii  i was happy to see that i can order online  however i purchase the  pack and they overstuffed the box  there is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box  they choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages  it is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared but rounded somewhat  the postal service does not treat the package with care so when it arrived there was a wet stain  when we opened it two packages had been damaged and the butter leaked all over all the other packages  we had to spend a long time washing all the packages because they are all greasy  the greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap  now when eating them some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing they are not airtight packages  so when popping them there are a lot of unpopped kernels  they should use bigger boxes and wrap it better
3013,4,okay not like the butter most people would expect but a very smooth full and slightly savory vegetal flavor the first time you take a sip you might not notice it but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip the more you drink it the more it will become apparent it is very soothing to the palletbr br jin xuan golden lily oolong from summit tea company it a good if not great tea especially for the price and quantity you get a solid every day drinker it is not as complex as some that ive had but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions depending on how you brew it a serving of these leaves is good for  infusions before the flavor wanes making it an even better value and even then the broth is soft and sweetbr br if you like your oolongs more on the green side then you should give it a try i know ill be ordering another tin
3014,5,i eat these tuna cups or the salmon cups almost dailybr br if youre looking for a nutritious snack these cups really cant be beat  if youre a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake these are awesome  if youre a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy getting them to like fish is a great idea  if youre trying to eat  meals a day to lose weight make one of these cups one of your meals the protein fills you up and makes you feel good  it also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experiencebr br why eat a nutritionally empty  calorie pack of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only  calories and infinitely more nutritional benefitbr br ill eat these alone straight from the cup basically anywhere since you dont need to refridgerate and you dont need a can opener  ill dump them onto salad or mix with rice quinoa or beansbr br heres the nutrition data off the back for  oz cup at the time of writingbr br calories   from fatbr total fat gbr cholesterol mgbr sodium mgbr total carb gbr protein gbr omega epadha mgbr br you really cant beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration  the package says in water but theres a little bit of broth in the cup and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup you probably cut the sodium down to mgbr br i highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well  but avoid the tuna salad or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit  those salads and flavorings just add salt sugar carbs
3015,5,although i prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages what i had ordered appears to no longer be available through amazon so i tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one  toss on a salad or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein
3016,5,cats are such finicky eaters some times  my old lady kitty does not like the canned cat foods but she always went nuts whenever id open a can of tuna for myself  so i gave her some one time  these tuna cups are a great way to keep the tuna fresh enough over a few days and good for travelbr br same items can be purchased at grocery store but buying in quantity through amazon saves some   thank you
3017,4,when im working i always carry my own lunch its so much better than the food court and i have much better regulation of my nutrient intake finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task tuna is excellent and these little chicken of the sea white tuna cups fill the bill put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts its good nutrition and theres no worry about weight gain also when im camping i like to take a batch of these tuna cups along in both cases the cup size just the right for one servingbr br i had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups and it might be just a batch problem my latest tuna was very dry i almost had to choke it down and it seemed rather tasteless ive had these cups in the past and they seemed much better i have not been satisfied with the present ones however i like the product and the serving size and it will not deter me from future purchasesbr br gary peterson
3018,5,i keep a stack of these tuna cups at work along with lemon juice and teriyaki sauce for variety  they are low calorie satisfying and nutritious  im sold on them now buy in bulk and keep on hand all the time
3019,2,if you want the best wild rice buy the regular kind this quick cook type is not near the taste quality of the regular  minute cook time rice
3020,5,this is the best one bobs red mill doesnt hold a candle to this its fluffy delicious and doesnt stick to the panbr i use  water to riceyum
3021,5,i like to put wild rice in many dishes this is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups
3022,4,i love portable electric corrals  they are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping etc  they are easy to use give your horse some walking around room  dont require a level setup area are flexible for sizeshape and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailers tack room  i much prefer using these to portable panels highlining tying to the trailer etcbr br there are many portable corral kits on the market all very similar with the same kinds of components  except the zareba ezee which is a different animal  so ill give you a componentbycomponent rundown on the items in this kitbr br charger  this kit comes with a charger that takes  d batteries  i was leery of this having had lessthanstellar performance from a d charger in the past  but this one works pretty good producing a reasonable strength zap with  feet of electric tape with good grounding in damp solid soil  if your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing this should be sufficient  the charger is easy to use with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked  the onoff switch is very accessible and a light and an audible sound tell you when its onbr br electric tape   this kit is advertised as coming with  feet of â½ tape  my kit had only  feet   feet is enough for one horse  i dont know where theyre coming with up the statement perfect for containing  horses for short periods of time  no way not even close even if i had received the full  feet  of course its easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store  but beware that the more tape you add on the less zap youll get from your charger  so im not sure if the d charger would be strong enough with  feet of tape  the tape in this kit comes with a handle preinstalled  its a nice handle with a good feel to it but it doesnt connect nicely to the posts  i rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle tobr br stepin posts  these are my favorite kind of stepin posts  each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through so you can set at the right height  its very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips making setup and takedown easierbr br corner guy lines  this kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes  honestly ill probably never use them  with this style of fence there usually isnt much if any tension on the posts so  ive needed corner guy lines  why add to setup and takedown time  but if you prefer to use the corner guy lines i think youll like the ones in this kit  they are nice quality adjustable lines with metal stakesbr br wires ground rod etc  of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence and the charger to ground  the ground rod is a  pointed spike  nothing special herebr br carrying bag  oh my gosh a for this carrying bag  the bag has one long skinny section for the posts and a separate snapoff zipper tote for the other components  within the smaller bag there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece  no more jumble of stuff  i love it  one quibble  one of the stepin posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping  the bag is made of pretty heavyduty fabric but not quite heavyduty enough to stand up to a pointed spike  and the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problembr br all in all this portable fence kit is about as good as any ive seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral  just dont expect it to contain  horses  unless youre rotating those horses in and out one at a time
3023,3,although i think this pen is greati didnt receive the entire roll of polytapeeven after calling customer serviceand i think the height of the posts is misleadinghence the  stars  if i wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own as my review below statesbr br easy onepage instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag without strugglingbr br i needed this portable paddock for my goats because i have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area  i was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so i called customer servicethe rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well  however several days later i called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage  this particular energizer is  volts and that goats needed  to  volts but he said i could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that i have  i have older very mellow goats so the  volts are working so farbr br i have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldnt be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights  however even though the post is listed as ft high i measured and they are actually    inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground you are left with a height of  inches  the tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at  inches off the ground  seems awfully short for horses but i dont know anything about horses eitherbr br the instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams making it all very easy to put together  i did have problems at the end tying it to the last post  i had to call customer service and the rep said that you cannot unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool which is per the instructions  since i had already unrolled it to the end i had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container which he said was okay but then its not easy to untie that knotbr br in lieu of posts you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop  guy wires which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability but i saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very wellbr br my ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily despite that  it had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil  the posts are sturdy and strong enough to not break with normal use  i did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts since the tips would not go past thembr br there is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass so i called customer service back to find that out he said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is not low impedance  so i had to mow where i wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding  not very practical when out on the roadbr br planning the fence was harder than i imagined because i couldnt make a perfect square and i thought i had measured correctly but still fell short of where i wanted the fence to end  i then discovered that i was only given  feet of polytape rather than the  feet  doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommendedbr br i wanted something that was easy  im a small middleaged female and needed something that wasnt too much trouble so i could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears  this is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape  it seems too short for horses but i posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses
3024,5,this product is both effective and convenient we were able to assemble it and have it working within  minutes it worked great as a maternity ward for our alpaca millay and her new cria we were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd i highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section
3025,4,this kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely i am using it for supplemental grazing of horses particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture but that get overgrown andor deliciousbr br i like it setup time once you figure out the components is about  minutes it has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral  tape posts charger ground and gate hookbr br the  stepin posts are fairly standard they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground you probably cant get them into rock hard dry ground but thats not a surprise there are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height but  youve probably seen them at the feed store  this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fencebr br the kit is supposed to come with  of  electric tape mine as a vine kit only had  this is enough for one very well behaved horse in a x square the tape is not much of a visual barrier especially with only one strand this is not a fence id trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods  would be enough for either two strands or to have a x square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time  x  is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial it would be straightforward to add tape but adding distance also increases the load on the chargerbr br the product description says  horses i would not feel safe doing that two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence maybe three for very brief periods if you had the  x  and were nearby or had a secure outer fence for grazing three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hoursbr br the charger  which uses  d batteries  has plenty of zap new i was pleased by how easy it was to work with it has its own spike allowing you to set it up away from the fence  the connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range the grounding nail was easy to set up and pull outbr br i like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system you can set it up without the corner braces depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is but when you need the braces youre glad to have the optionbr br the tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed its a simple thing and thoughtfully done it makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up and easy to reroll when putting it away there is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourselfbr br the hook for the gate isnt quite a match for the brackets on the posts a little bigger hook or some sort of metal bracket would be nice to give a sense of a more secure latch still youre counting on the fence never being touched so its not a big problembr br the bag for the kit is amazing everything fits inside beautifully with thoughtful pockets  even a special pocket for the instructions it is easy to carry and extremely organized i was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts the bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag sectionbr br this is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence
3026,4,i havent owned a portable fence for horses until now but i am impressed and liking this product very much upon opening the package i was happy with the portability of the carrying bag and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is its a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses once set up it wont hold more than two of our horses comfortably i dont think wed ever try and manage to get  inside like the product advertisesbr br the instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it i can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well such as alpacas but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them  the step in posts are fantastically designed the overall design makes the fence very versatile setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an gobr br were very happy with its design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system i think
3027,5,i am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way and i have never been happy hobbling my horse  id rather she could escape from a dangerous situation and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home sooo  here we have this device that is compact and weighs only  pounds thus is easy to pack for trail rides and since it operates on easilyobtainable d cells no problem being off the gridbr br the fishock hc portable paddock showed up in a nice durable red cordura nylon case the long part contains eight molded reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom into the ground their working height seems to be just about  feet multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in setupbr br a smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps it contains  of conductive tape on a reel no i dont know why the product description says  the transformer of nicely molded durablelooking green plastic a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground a shoulder strap and two d cell batteries which i promptly put in a safer place so they couldnt accidentally contact conductive material and dischargebr br this proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape properly set up the paddocks batteries did not drain of course i carried extras i also chose to guy the corners which i am used to with tents of course i had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose no problembr br this worked for one nothuge horse who is trained to electric fences so she doesnt challenge them sure any beast of her size could easily break out but id want her to if in danger no i cant see how the stated  or  horses could be contained in this enclosure but this a viable solution on the trail for my mare
3028,5,got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses  it works fine for that purpose the size is perfect and worked like a charm  the two horses didnt attempt a getaway at leastbr br easy to put up and easy to take down along with the portability makes this a camping winner
3029,5,i dont have horses so i am not using this in the traditional waybr br our backyard is being redone and all the fences are down  with a pool there though covered i was concerned about the wanderers etc so this came in handy and it was so easy to set up
3030,4,this is a great temporary fence for  or  horses it is kinda unwieldy and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup
3031,5,i bought this color for a cake replica of the stanley cup that i made  i was using this color for the very first time and i have to say that it was perfect  i was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte but it had a sheen and was exactly what i was hoping for
3032,5,this is the first time i have found a us produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle a lot of other truffle oils just have truffle aroma whatever that is and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant you can definitely taste the difference as well
3033,5,these cookies are amazing they taste as good as if not better than the original brands i only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie
3034,5,these cookies are ridiculous  they are just as delectable as  well any popular chocolatesandwichwithcreamcentercookie you can think of   when you compare them they are slightly larger in serving size g bigger and still they have about  fewer calories the same fat sugar and carb content but  less saturated fat three times the fiber and are much more nutritious loads of vitamins minerals etc plus you dont have to eat  cookies you can just have one or two good luck  everyone who has come to my house has asked to try one and they went crazy for them  if you are craving something sweet after a meal and still want to put good things into your body you will absolutely love these cookies delicious to munch and no weird aftertaste whatsoever unlike the whonu chocolate chip cookies  just sweet chocolatey oreoesque yumminessbr br i will say though that i cannot for the life of me figure out why theyre so expensive on amazon maybe because theyre not in every grocery store yet so when combined with shipping amazon can get away with charging a little more  who knows i know i bought them here for convenience and im so glad i got three boxes  i know you can find them in shoprite or walmart for around br br wherever you end up getting them enjoy
3035,5,these chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you true they have almost the same sugar fat and carb amounts of the bestknown name brand of these cookies but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand this is a plusbr br theyre really good as a snack and its hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies but i guess im allowed an occasional guilty pleasure as i write this they are a bit too expensive on this website try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your doorbr br overall these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu are the best i definitely recommend them as an excellent healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookiebr br i love em enjoy
3036,5,i bought these locally not from amazon im in arizona and they are sold in albertsons and bashas stores they are absolutely delicious and taste just like other cookies i bought all four of the flavors to test them out the only one i didnt like was the chewy chocolate chip all others though are wonderful i count calories and try to eat healthy but i do indulge with treats sometimes this is the perfect treat since it has all the vitamins and fiber i will never eat a regular cookie again whats the point when you can actually get nutrition from tasty cookies
3037,2,i love these cookies they taste exactly like oreos but unfortunately every time i eat them  cookies at a timei get horrible headaches and migraines which i dont get from real oreos its obviously caused by some of the nutritious ingredients another thumbs downthey include vitamin k which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners or for anyone middleaged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warnedvitamin k can cause blood clotsbr headache  migraine sufferers beware of these cookies
3038,3,i really liked these cookies when they first came out  but then i got a little tired of them  they have a bit of a gritty texture and they dont taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an oreo  they are worth eating if you have a bad craving but i cant eat more than one or two  the different taste gets to me  there may be an ingredient in them that doesnt agree with me  they contain vegetable oils just like oreos do  palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use  when i eat it it leaves a thick greasy film in my mouth and throat  storemade cake frostings cookies cupcakesanything that has it leaves that feeling and i dont like it at all  some are worse than others making it hard to swallow  this happened when i ate a doublestuf chocolate whonu cookie  palm oil is listed as an ingredient  i stopped buying them and the regular chocolate  i only get the vanilla version  they contain palm oil as well but im guessing it is less because they dont bother me  i like them much better  its weird because i like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general  but with whonu the vanilla wins for mebr br yesterday i had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie and i bought oreos  even oreos dont taste as good as they used to  i guess since the trans fat change in products  the whonu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients and less sodium  but the oreos have a better flavor  the difference in fat content doesnt seem to be very different  actually the difference in sodium doesnt seem very significant either  i decided id rather eat a few oreos than a few of these  its something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons
3039,5,this review is based on taste only not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies  i wrote three sort of similar reviews for this brand of cookies  this review is for those who are looking for a cookie because they want a cookie not vitamins or fiber or whatever  i bought them because i have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus i had a coupon  i purchased the crispy cookies the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies  i thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again i found these cookies to taste very good very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an oreo  oreos might taste a wee bit better but then theyre oreos come on  a cool fact i found out when i was looking up ingredients for whonu chocolate sandwich cookies and oreos the first ingredient in regular oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies i think it is flour  i found that interesting for some reason  anyway out of the three flavors i tried this was my least favorite but only because i like vanilla alot these are still great tasting chocolate sandwich cookies
3040,4,these are grossly overpriced  it is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be you then have to pay for shipping  sorry i would skip them  my local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from  to  each  although these are healthier than some other cookies you still have to watch the fat sugar and salt contents  whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging these fit the bill  just the price on this site is ridiculous  ask your grocer to start carrying them
3041,1,we purchased this product and were greatly disappointed  the product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have  we contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us  we never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again  very expensive and no quality  stay away from this company  we lived in spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like
3042,5,i purchased cafe excellence crazy caramel flavored whole beanbr coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great
3043,5,great fresh coffee beans gave as a christmas gift we all had some of it and loved it the smell was great and the flavour was awsome
3044,5,this gum is my absolute favorite by purchasing on amazon i can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price i highly recommend to all gum chewers plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time
3045,5,took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum but when i found wrigleys orbit white peppermint the search ended ive been chewing this gum for many years now i occasionally try something else but nothing ever wins the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath and toward the end of its chewable life it doesnt start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do it simply loses its flavorbr br only drawbacks i usually chew  pieces at a time so they are a bit small and  they just changed the packaging it used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket inside suit jacket pocket etc now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so its bulky not sure why they had to change probably to do with retail stores layout this wont prevent me from buying it but its really annoying wrigley just never change the flavor
3046,5,i bought these for my girlfriend who just happens to live in california and she loved them the chocolates came fresh and the packaging was just beautifulbr br handwritten card her name was handwritten on the front of the card and extra care was taken in the whole process i will definitely buy again from choclatiquebr br if i could rate higher i would i was sent a  refund for the shipping because my girlfriend lived nearby ive never had such an honest company before that was pretty cool
3047,5,got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers  they were yummy and a big hit with everyone  would definitely buy again
3048,5,i was starting to think that snyder and i just didnt share the same idea about whats good in snack flavors i have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors buffalo wing and honey mustard and was very disappointed i have to say that these cheddar cheese flavor pieces are not just good but spectacularly good they have a very rich buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste these are totally addictive its very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting
3049,5,very tasty cheese flavor because of crunch and small pieces of mixed size it goes a long way without adding too many calories a good buy walt b apple valley
3050,5,my husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these i dont see the draw being firmly in the potato chip camp myself but to each his own our local stores only stock these occasionally so he has tried all the other flavors and while he does like the jalapeno they dont like him back its nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them
3051,5,my daughter loves these snacks and cant get them in china where she is working now so i ordered them for her very satisfied and she was very appreciative
3052,5,when we get very busy in our home i like this sausage a lot for quick meal options the flavor is a bit sweet and works well with lots of types of vegetables usually ill slice it lengthwise and saute it until done then add sweet potatoespotatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet with a bit of cheese on top its all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for for that i cut the sausage into coins and cook it up then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking the sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and its just so easy to make
3053,5,i use these to keep my finicky toddlers protein levels up whats great is that theyre delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausagebr br a favorite recipe sautee one large onion about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano and some salt and pepper in about t of butter add sausage thats been cut into coins and russet potatoes cut into  thick rounds cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved throw in a few handfuls of prewashed baby spinach i usually use about a half a pound and frozen would work fine just put it in a minute earlier stir until the spinach is cooked and then serve enjoy
3054,5,having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker we discovered green mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee  i love the island coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a nd seat  the roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through  try it with a little chocolate coffee mate creamer and youll swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the islands  yum
3055,5,the best smooth tasting new coffee we have had since we have been to the islandsall good as ice coffee
3056,5,if youre looking for a very light refreshing coffee this one is for you  nice coconut flavor without any bitterness  may be too light for some people
3057,3,i was really looking forward to the dulce de leche cheerios  the honey nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealingbr br the first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy  but the more i ate the less i enjoyed it  the caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well  oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar i thought cheerios were always oat cereals all things considered especially price ill stick with honey nutbr br they tasted pretty good just plain from the box so i think ill save them for when i want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary  ill pour out a handful and eat them like a toddlerbr br i expected these to be more sugary than the honey nut but these have  grams of sugar per serving compared to  grams for the honey nut  but they have the same total carbohydrates  grams per serving so there isnt much difference in how it affects your bodybr br bottom line  i wont buy them again
3058,5,i became addicted to eating these the first time i tasted them which was years ago once you eat one you just cant stop until theyre gone they arent too sweet and make the perfect snack i love these things
3059,5,my synagogues passover care package had some of these candies in it and wow are they good  americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun  time to taste these nutty little wonders  individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down grins  better than peanut brittle any day  and these are kosher for passover
3060,1,ive had many types of pepper jelly and this is by far the worst ever the price is high and the taste is not good the shipping was outrageous more costly than the green pepper jelly dont waste you money
3061,5,this is amongst the best karachi halwa i have eaten not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other onesjust perfect individually wrapped pieces in the box
3062,5,im allergic to wheat so i have few options for pasta  corn pasta has a grainy texture that i dont care for quinoa pasta is the same and rice pasta has a tendency to stick together  this orgran pasta is perfect  i think i even overcooked it a bit and it still held its shapes farm animals and it was delicious  my husband also agreed that it was really good  the calorie count seems a little lower than other pastas as well  i will continue to order this product as long as amazon carries it  its grrrrrrrreat
3063,5,my celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta  it is by far her favorite  we make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day  she loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite  a must have
3064,5,i ordered this pasta because i thought my children would love the animal shapes since i am the only glutenfree in our home i try to find fun things for the entire family instead of making  separate meals when i served this at dinner the other night my husbands expression said it all he followed his surprised look with now this is pasta we could not believe how good this pasta was we are now hooked i can not wait to try some more of the orgran products
3065,5,i have to eat gluten free but my family doesnt  this is the only pasta so far that my kids cant see a real difference  they like it a lot  this is one i fix when i dont have time or energy to fix separate things for them and myself  because it tastes yummy for all of us
3066,3,these brownies bake up very nicely  i would call their consistency cake like  however my husband called them healthy brownies  he said he could taste the flax seed  i tend to agree  in my opinion if im going to eat chocolate i dont want it to have that healthy taste  on the other hand i love the blueberry muffins that hodgson mill makes
3067,5,i have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son this is a great after dinner dessert that i feel good about giving him and myself they are healthy and you can taste the flax seed in them but i have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture i even come to crave it now they are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them i buy them in bulk and love other hodgson mill products as wellbr br   if you eat nothing but white flour products and cant get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture then this is not the product for you if you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product i still love to have my junk food pillsbury and hersheys here i come i just try to have it only on very special occasions the rest of the time i choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds that is when i reach for this brownie mixbr br   my only complaint is that they dont taste too great after only a couple days so make up a batch eat em up quick within  days and you will be smiling
3068,5,good but i add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp of baking powder along with a couple of tbsp of cocoa powder because i like brownies a little higher and more cake like  they come yummy and with the added flour theyre not too sweet
3069,5,my kids love brownies but i could no longer by the regular brands in the grocery store with a good conscious  i still wanted the convenience of a mix though  these fit the bill  they first time i made them they thought they tasted funny because they were so used to the processed crap  now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste  i think they are yummybr these are in no way lowcalorie or lowfat though  instructions call for a lot of oil eggs and butter you can use earth balance and egg replacer if youre vegan  flax seeds also have a good amount of fat although the healthy kind ive made them with olive oil before and they were just as good  ive also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey but they really dont need it  i love the chewy texture of the flax seeds  there are very few ingredients i could probably make the same brownies homemade but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds etc  these are easy and yummy  even though they are not necessarily healthy from a calorie and fat standpoint i can feel good about giving my kids treats that arent loaded with processed crap
3070,5,add walnuts to this healthful brownie and perhaps a light iceing  do not overback or it will be very dry  lots of good stuff in this brownie  but the flax taste is a little strong  i really feel no guilt when having a brownie snack for me or my kids
3071,5,i really like this brownie mix  unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them  hence buying them from amazon  they are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely  very moist and i think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor  yes they are healthy and are more dense than traditional brownies  but they fill my chocolate craving better and i really feel like i have eaten dessert  not just some fluff from a box  
3072,5,i made these according to package directions and added  cup of mini chocolate chips and they were awesome  they took longer to cook than the box says maybe thats because of the chocolate chips  either way they were great and ill definitely make them again
3073,4,for quite a while before amazon starting retailing food items it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy undergroundfavorite brownie mix there were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate  so when we saw it on amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family the concensus was it tastes healthier but never the less quite good it is far better when prepared with at least a cup of minichocolate chips not regular chips which can sink to the bottom we buy good quality belgian chocolate minichips this mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures
3074,5,of course they dont taste quite as good as regular brownies but hello  thats because theyre healthy  and that being said they are fantastic  why eat crap when there are such good alternatives
3075,5,if your not into healthy and into flax seed do not buy these  they are healthy and they taste like it  i love themthey are very good  my husband loved them too  its all a matter of taste  if youre looking for a dunkan hines brownie these are not it
3076,2,im a big fan of hodgson mill products we love their bread mixes i use their pancake mixes im not afraid of whole grains  i mill my own grains wheat kamut rye barley and i even put milled flax seed in my home made yogurt ive been a baker for  years and love to try new recipesbr br i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth  i can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the boxbr br one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed wellbr br i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch  a little bit of time required a little less convenient but brownies being a treat and comfort food the texture should be right 
3077,4,we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit drybr br we still buy this by the case
3078,4,these brownies are good but the flax seed texture can be a real turnoff  to minimize it i added a little whole wheat flour splenda and cocoa  big improvement and my guests never complained like they did the first time i made the brownies
3079,3,i like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy  it is also very oily even after you cook it  if you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product  also they are not very chocolately so i added chocolate chips to the recepie  it makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way
3080,5,you can taste the flaxseed in these wholewheat muffins and its a great taste  good chocolate flavor and texture  i add chopped walnuts
3081,5,if you are used to eating flaxseed then this is the brownie for you  hodgson mill brownies are super easy to make and taste great  since i like dark chocolate i usually add a little more cocoa
3082,3,i was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies  its ok but not what i would serve to company  i substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem  of course i wound up eating them all anyway
3083,1,first off i love whole wheat products and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch and no it wasnt expired i checked the date but my mom and i just had some of these and were not fans they had an oddly fishygrassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets oo
3084,5,i received all the ingredients in a timely manner all the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages it was more than i needed for the meal i was making so i had plenty of left over ingredients
3085,5,the produce was extremely fresh  i made a delicious thai soup with the items and had plenty to spare
3086,5,exceptionally fresh quality and quantity and shipped much faster than expected i was able to make great tom yum soup  thank youa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbpaifresh thai produce kita
3087,5,i first tried this tea at at french restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint to my surprise this tea beats any tea without milk no sugar needed it is naturally sweetened
3088,5,love this hot chocolatenice creamy flavor  the price is good and i love the single packs  this is not a flavor available to me locally
3089,5,i love the chamomile tea its sweet and mild its excellent for a bed time tea
3090,5,with all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the betterbr i love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly
3091,5,i dont know which herb is so tasty in here but its a great combination  i dont like licorice flavors and this tea is great because i can reap the great benefits of licorice root without tasting itbr br it really does help my symptoms and drinking it for prevention has worked great for me as well  and you cannot beat the shipping price free with super saver shipping with amazon
3092,5,i always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold he actually now asks for it i prepare it and put it in a thermo for him to drink during the day at school it works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious the throat does heal from this tea if he starts it after the illness has taken full course it still helps it sooth it a lot my son loves it and i have recommended to other friends who now buy it all the time great effective results
3093,5,we just got our first order a few days ago and my  month old daughter loves them theyre just like the gerber mini veggies but much cheaper although they still cost a good bit having a nutrient filled easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it my daughter doesnt have any teeth yet and she hasnt had any problems eating them theyre light and fluffy yet full of flavor
3094,5,i dont know why my toddler is so crazy about these but he is  he was snacking on so many cheerios every day that i was desperate to find something else that he would like but wouldnt require refrigeration and this saved the day  i feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these
3095,5,my dog has heart failure and cant have the standard dog treats because of the salt these are perfect she likes to hunt for her snacks and these are perfect to toss out to her and let her go nuts  she really likes them 
3096,1,ive been buying these for nearly  years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them they are darker green than usual which was not a problem but the texture was chewier and the flavor wasnt as good this is a problem since its the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues the taste  texture were so different he was gagging not pleased with the change
3097,5,these are a delicious guilt free snack that i always have handy they are so convenient and last a long time i also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful you can get them at whole foods but not at this price
3098,5,we first tried this because our toddler went through a pickyeater phase she loved these they are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up i love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for i mainly give them to her right out the package but ive also mixed them into scrambled eggs which she really likes too
3099,5,these taste great and have a great texturebr br our yearold has little interest in eating fresh vegetables but she loves these  she actually prefers these over goldfish crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value  to me that fact is worth the expense  it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables
3100,5,we love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies  they make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our  year old
3101,4,my month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food  they are tasty healthy and have zero additives  on the downside every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking rock  i can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth so i worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth  that being said its been months and nothing bad has happenedand it hasnt worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas its just something that i feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product
3102,5,feel like a protein boost  got the nibbles  dont want to succumb to potato chips  heres a great alternative  just dont let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making  for an expensive snack for the dog and a grumpy mommy
3103,3,i like the dried peas from just tomatoes and i also like their just corn  they are way too expensive though  they are really handy because i dont use frozen or canned foods because i follow an ayurvedic diet which prohibits them  when i can not find fresh peas i have to use these  i will probably have to do without as i cant afford these too bad
3104,1,even though this item is listed under the gluten free category it is not  the ingredients state that it contains wheat protein  do not order this if you need gf food  bad reviewing by amazon
3105,5,i bought this for christmas and gave a few away as gifts  you get a bunch of boxes but if you love bacon there are a lot of uses for it  ive made sour cream chip dip cheese balls added to mashed potatoes and mac  cheese sprinkled on baked potatoes in place of bacon bits  if you can dream it you can do itbr br the bacon flavor is not over powering it is a subtle delicious taste  i love davis  davis products and will be trying different varieties for sure
3106,5,dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs  but it is really a great product
3107,5,for serious goat cheese lovers this is a step up from the french goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store i had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation the creamy smooth a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor i used it sprinkled over a tomato bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an applezucchini relish from the  cookbooks blog outstanding artisan cheese that i look forward to enjoying again
3108,5,if you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this  it has a very smokey creamy flavor  try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil
3109,5,i have a history of mildmoderate acid reflux so i take it easy with coffee i was delighted to discover puroast which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced the french roast flavor is utterly delicious it tastes like i went to a coffee house for fancy coffee but its just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen even more convenient if my husband does it for me try it  you wont be disappointed the cinnamon flavor is also very very good
3110,5,i havent been able to drink coffee for over  years due to gastritis and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff  coffee is my favorite and reaching desperation i gave puroast a try  this stuff is a miracle not only am i symptomfree it is good coffee  i am so thankful to be able to have coffee back in my life
3111,5,i was delighted to discover this richtasting coffee which has half the acid of regular brands i served it to a guest with an acid reflux problem and she not only enjoyed the cuppa she reported that she felt fine afterwards this is a great coffee to have in your pantry for finicky guests or to stock for discerning coffeedrinkers who find the taste of starbucks and dunkin donuts simply too harsh also loved the charming packaging
3112,4,this coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems  the low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day  maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend but im so thankful for it  really close in taste
3113,5,ive been using this low acid coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste i enjoy not having an acid stomach especially the morning after  to me there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffeebr br i give it  stars
3114,5,i decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth swelling  puroast did the trick  plus it tastes great  couldnt be happier with it although i wish they would bring the organic decaf back
3115,5,my wife and i tried this product a few days ago we were not disappointed the coffee had a good flavor and the low acid was a nice added benefit
3116,3,i struggle between giving this  or  even  stars  because i am just thankful for the substitute as i have a condition that i need low acid coffee for however i do have to admit it tastes like burnt coffee as someone else put it and it is no peets or starbucks the taste and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done is something i dont think i will ever get used tobr br update i had my father in law up would like to say that if you are one like he is that puts mounds of creamer and sugar in your coffeeapparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another hope that helps
3117,3,if you dont want to give up the taste of coffee but cant handle the acid try this coffee does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects
3118,3,i love love love dark roasted coffee and dont like a acid taste so i thought this would be greatbr br i was pleased with the no acid taste buti had to use twice as much to get the same flavor i usually like that wouldnt be a big deal but it meant i went through the coffee faster than i should have and that can get expensivebr br this blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press i was able to use it with a pour over
3119,2,a short while ago my doctor looked me in the eye and said buddy you got acid reflux real bad  my dentist said the same  only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing worst case scenario pictures of teeth on battery acid he put me off coffee for a week  so with that doublewhammy in mind ive lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods  hence my decision to go the lowacid coffee routebr br and like the headline says this coffee is a good news bad news situationbr br first the good news puroast coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately lowacid  ive noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking itbr br now the bad news this coffee is kinda bad  i should note this isnt the opinion of a coffee snob  while i like a good cup of peets coffee as much as the next guy im aokay with a batch of folgers or the basic house brand of whatever chain store i happen to be shopping in  im usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isnt highway robberybr br alas for all of its low acidity and decent price this coffee aint that pleasant kick start  theres an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe  other than to say that puroast doesnt really taste like french roast coffee  even doctored up with cinnamon and milk the unpleasant flavor remainsbr br so yes this coffee is effective if you absolutely need to have coffee  but if youre looking for a pleasant low acid kick start to your day black tea might be a better tastier option
3120,4,i didnt have high expectations that i would like this but i love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid i am a starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous i still prefer the taste of starbucks houseblend but now im not sure the extra body is worth the acid this is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it give it a try
3121,5,this is a great company  and the first i have ever seen to offer a low acid option you can absolutely taste the difference its coffee without the bitterness  makes it possible to enjoy the purity of the bean without the bitter taste they also have very cool black mugs  love them
3122,1,i drink  cups a day of verona italian or french roast coffee and wanted to try a loweracid version this brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar it is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you
3123,1,this coffee tastes so nasty i cant even drink it its disgusting i cant believe anything this bitter is acid free i actually threw away two bags
3124,1,flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee but i decided id rather take massive doses of pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill
3125,2,this coffee smells really bad  there is definitely no delicious smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug  it tastes just as awful too  the first couple sips that i had with my nose closed so i couldnt smell it wasnt too bad but the more sips i took the more disgusting it was  it is absolutely stomach turning to me at least and unfortunately i will never drink the whole bag it tastes like a weak poorly brewed cheap cup of coffee though not cheap  the only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder  just irritated my nose and taste buds
3126,4,i use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg which greatly improves the texture when made with just water and a small amount of butter the crust comes out very very chewy in my breadmachine i have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet
3127,5,i have tried many bread machine mixes and most have been okay but this one rates an excellent because not only is it a very good basic loaf it also works very well with additives either prepared entirely in the bread machine or after the second rise removed from the machine shaped and baked on a stone in the ovenbr stretched and flattened with a filling of either savory or sweet ingredients then rolled and set to rise and then bake in a loaf pan it produced excellent herb and onion bread cinnamon raisin bread and a brown butter and seed breadbr i buy it via the subscribeandsave plan as i use it often
3128,5,i love fresh bread and hodgson brand is awesome i usually just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go even if the brand is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals but most of all they taste great all it requires is some water and shorteningbutter or oil i have even been able to use applesauce instead of oil but it didnt get as rich taste i have ordered all varieties they had on amazon whole wheat honey is specially tasty no more supermarket bread
3129,5,i must admit when i first ordered this bread for my new panasonic bread maker i was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as i buy at a nearby store however was i ever surprised it was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia i just could not believe how good it was and is since the first loaf i have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread it is really good perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine highly recommended  general info the package makes a  pound loaf on my machine the recommended setting is basic and the loaf bakes in  hours also the flour is non gmo verified as labelled
3130,5,since i started making hodgson wholesome potato bread my husband will not eat store bought bread anymore  we make about two loaves a week in different varieties of the hodgson mill brand  the honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also greatbr i like using my old bread machine to make the dough then shape into loaf and bake in the oven  makes perfect loaf every time also makes delicious rollsbr glad i discovered this brand of bread mixes on amazonthey are wholesome and i know what im putting into the bread i bake now  great product
3131,5,i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust which i like i will order it again not much of a potato taste but good bread
3132,5,i recently purchased a bread machine and i tried  this potato bread mix  i have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time  the other great thing about this particular mix is that i have experimented with altering the amount of butter  in the last batch i actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water and it came out buttery and yuuuummmmmmyyyybr br i encourage everyone who has a bread machine to try this particular mix
3133,5,i am so totally satisfied by hodgson mill products  i probably have purchased   loaves at this point  i used some as a present to my brother with good results toobr br never have i seen old smelling mix nor have i ever had a yeast failure  their taste  texture is wonderful never have i had a slicing failure where you cant get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down the different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as chopped nuts or sesame seeds or millet seed or   use your own imagination  coming in nice units of  loaves makes pantry storage easy and once opened the carton yields  boxes with best by dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost goofproofedbr br next time you walk a grocery store note the prices there here again i think you really cant beat the quality with a really fair price that hodgson provides  it seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce  the best shipping available for their customersbr br buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last  years  i hope this helps decision making
3134,5,updated   finally have found a perfect match in taste to my irish grandmothers potato bread loaf pictured wdill added very tasty br br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbfdkqcyhodgson mill wholesome potato bread mix ounce boxes pack of abr br since now in the s and low teens wind chill  these  boxes will be used oftenbr br the picture shows this loaf made in older breadmaker  crust set dark for croutons and stuffing as well as fine bread crumbs for mac n cheese buttered toppingsbr br br have been using hodgsons mill products for years  ordered  sets of  boxed for breadmaker but intend to kick up the taste wcrushed in oil garlicdill cinnamonraisinswhole cranberriesand whatever else takes our fancy for dinner meals or great homemade soup dunkin  one can make any type roll or breadstick they choose also going to try as flat breadsbr br honey wheat on the way   sets delivered an hour ago  potato and caraway ryebr now to make a choice which will come first
3135,4,i love this bread  i dont even like the smell of commercial bread you can smell the chemicals from miles  i added rosemary garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine it was a hit with my dinner guests
3136,5,this was great  so soft so tasty  better than expected  perfect loaf every time
3137,3,i was a little disappointedi first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf  ok  next i will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven  i do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread  convenient is a plus
3138,5,i have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good i must say to my family and i that this is the best i have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that nice flavor great texture well worth the price i have bought this a few times on amazon and will continue to do so
3139,5,i am extremely satisfied with both hodgson mill bread mixes that i purchased online  the potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade so it was difficult to remove  otherwise the bread tasted great  the rye bread was also delicious  it didnnt rise as much and i had no trouble removing it from the bread machine  the rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loafbr br the only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs  i have since found out that i can purchase the same brand products at heb and kroger grocery stores and will not order online again
3140,5,i just got my bread machine for christmas so being a novice i thought i would try to keep it simple   the hodgson mill products are wonderful  everything is included even the yeast  the bread came out delicious it was easy to slice  it is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread  my family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well if you try this i think you will be happy with it
3141,5,this is a fantastic bread mix i do not use the bread machine i make it in a bowl hand made and have had no problems at all i do not know why people are having any problems with this it is terrific amazon please keep this in stock please
3142,5,i like this bread and several other flavors in this brand  this one and the seven grain are my favorites  they bake consistently well in my wolfgang puck machine  recommended
3143,5,this product is as good as any that i have ever used and is so convenient through amazon as it has become hard to find in the stores
3144,5,i love these bread mixes there is nothing like making your own bread i admit i use a bread maker  not clever enough to use my hands but i still enjoy the experience i have tried  different hodgson mixes and they are both excellent
3145,4,the potato bread was easy to mix rises well in my breadmaker cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty the bread has a near white bread texture and was very good i purchased all of the hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites
3146,5,i recently tried this line of breads on vacation and loved the one we tried i couldnt find the european cheese  herb flavor that we had locally so i went to order from amazoncom as happens from time to time the seller was out of that flavor so i picked up the potato bread instead and it was also very good  i still need to get the cheese  herb because that one was awesome
3147,5,this is delicious bread and i can quickly make up loaves of bread to eat or give away for a special gift
3148,5,my family and i all agree that hodgson mill potato bread is one of the best mixes on the market  a loaf of this bread lasts about two hours before it is gone  it has become a favorite of ours and we will be making lots  dont run out of this one
3149,1,i have made potato bread before with great results but this hodgson breadmix is way too dry it needs some more moisturedont buy it unless you want really dry bread
3150,3,howdy yallbr br this bread is pretty good the potato flavor is there recognizable as potato bread if youve had it before and not overwhelming makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an enjoyably different pseudobruschetta basebr br made it with vegetable oil and olive oil as usual the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavorbr br rated a three cuz its just exactly as expected  average with no surprisesbr br take carebr lee
3151,2,white bread is not my thing so thats probably why i dont like this one  i like herby white breads and really fullbodied white breads but otherwise i always choose whole grains  this one is not fullbodied and has no particular flavor  not interesting at all to me
3152,3,i am a bit disappointed  the flavor was not what i wanted or expected
3153,3,as a former chefowner of a restaurant in my younger years i was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the bookbinders white clam sauce wihtout doctoring  it is a great product for easy convenience
3154,5,to the gentleman who reviewed this and said just go to the store and get better well im disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carrycan you see me carrying two big cases of water home  i think notbr br this is wonderful water  sure you could get it on sale at a better price and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in please do so but for me it is a sweet deal  i ordered six cases and watched the ups guy set them inside the door for me  i have nothing to complain about  if the price is right for you with all considered you wont go wrong here
3155,5,this water is delicious im not picky but i can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that and at  cents per bottle delivered to your door its a great price i have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and its aokay with me better than drinking a coke
3156,5,i continue to buy this water as well as the larger size bottle for a number of reasonsbr  the taste of the water is just plain good refreshing crisp and clean  its not easy describing water that doesnt actually offendbr  our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issuesbr  the ups guy does all the heavy work for me  all i have to do is put it awaybr  i never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save programbr if i had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpackbr bottom line for me the taste and convenience are worth the price and ill continue to buy it as long as my budget allowsupdated note ive been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing my local kroger had ozarka spring water on sale so i picked up a case  wow was that ever a mistake even though the ozarka bottles are very light weight the taste of the water is so different from talkingrain spring water in that there is a distinct plasticy flavor ive alway enjoyed the ozarka in the past but had no idea i was settling for drinking plastic watermy goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on talkingrain spring wateri am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now
3157,5,i am a chemist so i know about water and why it can taste like heaven eg it is tasteless and why it can taste like sweat eg mineralenhanced this water is expensive  cheap for online but costly if you are a walmart or target shopper however i highly recommend you try this if you want tasteless water you see when water is mineral enhanced and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat the water tends to build a certain taste which some like and others dont i like my water tasteless therefore i recommend this product to those whom do not want ho  minerals but just plain water
3158,5,this was my first purchase of this water  it tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most  also everyone likes that namehaha
3159,5,water tastes good i typically prefer only purified water did a study on this in grad school back in the day but for use at the office this fills the bill i think it tastes good and looks presentablebr br bottles are of course recyclable so i dont feel guilty saying i like the quality of the bottle as well i once had someone pickup water and they got a chain grocer brand at a steal  but the bottle was so flimsy i dont like that one bit this is the best of both worldsbr br shipment arrived fully intact for me
3160,5,always glad to see this water delivered to our doorstep not a drop of it spilled during delivery yet due to  nice quality of  bottlesbr even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in with the tape flopping  must say the shrink wrapping has held and the bottles themselves havent spilled a drop of the waterbr   were on our third case of  it right now and very happy with this purchase  the water tastes good and the bottles hold their shapebr br  about weight  of these bottles commented upon in another review i thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes i do drive a few bottles to work in the car i dont backpack them  not a really obvious difference in weight though i think maybe necessary for shippingbr br   guess its like choosing sleeping bagsif you are using a vehicle you can  use a heavier sleeping bag so they tell mebr  anyway i think youll like this water and you get  bottles per case instead of the usual br we plan to order more  were glad we can do this
3161,1,three of us tried it one of us was barely able to drink it with ice  i guess this is like evian an acquired taste  unless youre able to try a single bottle before purchase i recommend you pass
3162,5,this water is really good  it is reasonably priced  it is mountain spring water  please order at least once you will not regret it  it is priced right  you get qt ounce bottles for a great price  use your standard shipping  to  days i think free shipping  that way you can buy more product  be aware that this is very popular product and sometimes amazon is out of stock  so you may have to wait  or  weeks  but it is worth the wait  it is a great product
3163,5,i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere until i bought this brand best i have ever tasted no chemical aftertaste  i have  cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener mercy as others have stated the ups man does all the hard work and i dont have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household
3164,5,i bought this water for my  pet chinchillas tank and tony they love this water i have never seen them drink so much in their lives i bought this water because chinchillas cannot drink tap water and spring water is the best for thembr i am mad though because i purchased this item  week ago and now its  cheaper wtfbr overall i love this item great waterbr i tasted it for myself and it does taste great
3165,5,love this water  feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it  really love the bottles  nice and sturdy  no squishy plastic  and since i had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store love the automatic delivery to my back door  a little more money than store brands but well worth it
3166,2,i have a recurring shipment of this product each month  every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and very mangled  last month one of the cases of water had to be repackaged before it arrived and it was a day latebr br i suggest using a more sturdy box for shippingbr br the water product is fine  its just the shipping packaging i have a problem with
3167,4,i enjoyed this water  it was very refreshing  i find i have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters  i did not have that problem with this water  nice bottles  water comes from washington
3168,3,this water is pretty good but not great at the time i got it it was the most economical water that shipped free with prime so if they keep that up it will be a great deal for a lot of peoplebr br i might be tainted because i was just up in washington where this water is from and almost all of the bottled water i got up there plus the tap water was better than this but i love washington water so im probably judging it too harshlybr br its not bad and it does have a unique water taste so im sure this will be someones absolute favorite water no one will hate this waterbr br prosbr this is good waterbr has a unique tastebr everyone will like it but not a lot of people will ask for morebr br consbr i expect more from washington water than this
3169,3,i bought this water when i was at college for the first week i felt bad using my roommates water all the time and i was  states away from home so i ordered this water it was delicious but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were reallywellplasticy i felt really ungreen drinking water out of these huge plastic bottlesbr br so now i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends i give her   she runs to walmart and gets me  cases of  water bottles yay mebr br sometimes i still think about this water longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramenjuice and say to myself this would be so much better with talking rainbr br its one college students battle between deliciousness and ecofriendliness
3170,2,somehow my previous review got deleted i live in houston tx i buy lots of bottled watercannot tell any difference between a bottle of talking rain and a glass of cold tap water
3171,1,yes the water appears clear but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy why is that well it means it has impurities perhaps bacteria im a registered nurse not a water expert but i can tell you that i am right about the water i can run my well water from my tap and get the same results its awful  i normally use brita filters with the pitcher provided and when i heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear this means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process it means youd be better off drinking the brita water i gave this bottle water a chance i got a second case and the same thing happen i wouldnt drink this water straight from the bottle ever as a nurse i know its not a good idea  if you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteriaimpurities you can make lipton tea hot then as it cools down if the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities i used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well so nothing is different except the tea  tried the brita water and brita made ice cubes and it remained clear  sorry not a good review from me i am afraidbr br  i was very disappointed as i thought yeah a bottled water i can carry to work so i am not force to pay  for a bottle from the machine but it turn out not to be sobr br okay so i tried another company on this website nestles which in my region came as deer park i have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesntt turn cloudy when i boil it  so you be you own judge
3172,5,though this coffee was expensive compared to regular storebought i am a huge fan coffee usually tears up my stomach so ive been a tea drinker for years but this coffee has a lowacidic level so i can handle it the aroma is enticing and the bag lasted a long time i am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus it was prompt and the packaging ensured my coffee stayed fresh and intact
3173,5,i tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world i had to try it and it was worth every penny i am a dark chocolate fan normally  is my favorite but i have to say i would order this again and give it as a gift it melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful
3174,1,do not buy this if your thinking its only mango  ingredient says fruit juice blend organic white grape juice organic apple juice and organic pineapple juice from concentrate organic mango pureebr br i cancelled order as soon as i realized this drink had grape and pineapple
3175,5,i bought this juice because i really like mangoes it is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy will buy again
3176,5,these are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor  the bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price  so you get more of what you would normally pay for
3177,5,these are without question the best diet crackers ive ever had  ive had them with and without salt and since i usually put peanut butter on them i didnt need the saltbr br these are great for travel for kids and when you just need a very lowcalorie cracker
3178,5,i am not sure why the  speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out the cakes are  calories crunchy and goodnot like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes excellent as a base for pbj or to make an open face sandwich or to use in pieces like a chip for dips etc good price on the  pack with a  month expiration use date
3179,5,these stay together better than round ones which crumble terribly they are good alone or with my favorite artisana raw sesame butter they are very well packaged which keeps them from getting broken also each package i have opened has been fresh thanks for a great product amazon
3180,5,i love this product so much better than the regular thick rice cakes they are thin but very compact so i use them as a great sandwich bread alternative they dont break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes ive searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and cant find this product anywhere i love that they are now available for subscription through amazoncom
3181,5,these brown rice cakes are by far the best i have tried many i can not have very many foods these are my only snack food that i can have they are so good i dont feel like i am missing anything
3182,5,i waited long and with bated breath for amazon to restock the bulk packaging for this product as europeanstyle rice cakes are a pretty specific niche and they can be a bit difficult to find at local stores not to mention expensive these are a very different beast from the americanstyle rice cakes that most people associate with the nameas other reviews suggest these arent quite so airfilled or crumbly having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flatbread but unlike those these are glutenfree oilfree unsalted and contain only one ingredient  puffed brown rice theyve got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking but theyre a lot healthier than chips or crackers and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if youre mindful of blood sugar impact theyre also great for the occasional mild tummy upset since theyre light and bland and dont require the preparation of other bland foodsbr br try them with hummus my personal favorite peanut butter jam and a sprinkling of chia seeds yum
3183,5,i am so happy that amazon got these back in so i could order my second case i dont eat wheat it packs the pounds on me around my middle most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free they cost way too muchbr br i have eaten all kinds of rice cakes i have found that most will break apart if youre spreading a nut butter on them not these also there are generally  rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes this package of rice cakes has  pieces in each bag also its much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you dont eat too much of a good thingbr br try these if youre dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread i dont believe you will be sorry and amazons price is so good and free shipping though the box is sort of big its pretty light and stores easily away i live alone and im on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale i stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard boxbr br also they are made in belgium if that helps anyone the packaging is air tight and they come  pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and i have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake they are rather neutral in their taste i make a special butter spread that i like on them real well you take equal parts of room temperature butter olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth you can refrigerate this it sets up but doesnt get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good i use organic butter olive oil and filtered water but you dont have this spread is so good and i believe its better for you than straight butterbr br also i only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesnt seem to work as well but a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyablebr br hope this helps you decide to try them everyone ive given some to have had only good comments about them
3184,5,surprisingly tasty thin and crip very cracker like and good for snacking i got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet these are great for when we travel  it isnt easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good but these work quite well
3185,5,crispcrunchy and thin very low in sodium i usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping a great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores excellent product the rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet  sodium
3186,5,these crackers are greatthe beauty is not in their own flavor but the fact that they are a perfect crispy low calorie glutenfree delivery mechanism for all manner of spreads and slices  they dont come with overpowering artificial flavorings to compete with a topping of your choice  some of my favorites arepeanut butter and banana or laughing cow cheese with turkey pepperoni
3187,5,i live on salt and as a result have hypertension these products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible keep you alive longer and that is a scientific fact as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions keep caring about us and dont stop producing foods that are very healthy
3188,1,consumer reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market i like these crackers but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved
3189,5,these are not only a good value health food stores really jack up the prices on rice cakes but also are nicely thin and easy to use to spread stuff on
3190,5,i was able to do so much with these crackers  theyre easy to spread on and stack and put toppings on  i definitely enjoyed them and so did all my friends d
3191,5,susies thin cakes are a great snack if you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthy i bought the one that is sodium cholesterol fat and sugar free for three cakes it is only  calories so you can add a toppin like taboule or your favorite topping without the guilt they are very tasty the only problem is the availability of the product i am on a waiting list with amazon for this product
3192,5,i purchased these based on others recommendations the rice cakes are delicious thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets densenot full of air i covered them with pb those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for  calories a serving vs  for regular pb and it tastes exactly the same i too highly recommend these rice cakes
3193,5,brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea  i highly recommend this brand  it is by far the best bagged green tea i have found and i have tried about all of them  i brew one bag in a  oz mug for  minutes  absolutely perfect
3194,5,if you like green tea that brews for  minutes max and you do not stew your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter this is the tea for you of course it can be done that way but if you have refined tea taste then you will like this tea i personally love the taste of a good green tea i am so glad to find this brand available online no one sells it in my area
3195,5,i have tried many different brands of green tea and this one is by far the best one that i have ever tried the taste is so delicious and each tea bag is tightly sealed in its own special packet which keeps it totally fresh until you use it even the strings are totally natural with no metal at all which can affect the taste of the tea this is my new favorite tea and i am so glad that i discovered it
3196,5,i used to get these from sams wholesale club but with this economy i have not renewed my membership  so long story short i bought bumblebee canned clams and they were horrible  so then i bought geisha baby clams and they were not as horrible but i certainly would not put them in my clam chowder so i returned all the unopened cans of bumblebee and geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again  oh you go right ahead and try those other brands if you dont mind eating poop  cause thats about all you get  clam juice and clam poop  doxee snows clams are all clams and clam juice no clam poop
3197,1,ive been eating snows clam chowder for years so i buy a few cans when its on sale well it looks like bumble bee has taken over what a big mistake when i opened the can it was all watery and smelled funny i put it in a bowl to microwave and noticed how thin it was but thought id try it anyway it was nasty to say the least it about made me sick so i went and opened another of the new cans more of the same then i got an older can of the nonbumble bee chowder and it was great like always if i could give the new junk no stars i would sucks bad
3198,3,the clams were ok overall quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces product is good though
3199,5,this is the mother load of canned clams not just a can of juice with a few floaters but cups and cups of chopped clams i found no sand residualsand i was able to use every last drop of juicessimply devine recipe on the can best white clam sauce ive ever made
3200,4,i guess i thought of this can as being the usual commercial  can so the price of about  a can did not seem too bad but when they arrived i saw that these were somewhat smaller  they are less than a half gallon  i dont see the size as that much of a problem all i have to do is rethink how i would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase but if i saw that size can in a store i would not pay  for  oz canbr br i would have to see what fresh clams would cost first  i would like if they made the clams bigger chunks but i could buy some fresh to add to it  most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what snow makesbr br good product despite the price
3201,4,not much to say i ordered two large cans of chopped clams for some clam chowder that i will be making soon and they arrived in good condition and in a timely mannerbr br  i have not opened them yet but will in february at my bosss home in the country i will be making clam chowder in his kitchen with his wifes blessings there will be a small group of us there and we will be shooting guns as part of the days activities i hope they like the clam chowder things could get ugly lol
3202,4,these are great beans for the price if you live in a big city however id suggest buying green beans at a local ethiopian shop or even a community coop i also remember a pea berry out of east timor that was outstanding but this tanzanian pea berry is comparable to standard beans
3203,5,we have been using this food for about  months now and find it to be just excellent other than the fact our two dogs a coton de tulear lbs and standard poodle puppy lbs both love the food but are thriving  their coats are in excellent condition and their overall structure is perfect  good tasting to the dog and good for them and a good deal for the owner  all around the best food we have ever used  excellent
3204,5,im glad my lb cockerstandard poodle puppy loves the stuff because i trust the brand and its superior nutrition compare labels my previous feed pedigree was mostly corn my little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat also superior nutrition produces smaller compact stools
3205,5,i received the kcups on time and in execellant condition i usually drink coffee but at night the hot cocoa is good with a snack just before bed
3206,4,this is the best hot cocoa ive had in a kcup  the taste is smooth and creamy  its perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink  i would definitely recommend this product  the best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so i never run out
3207,5,im pregnant and had togive up my hot cup of coffee i thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice sure does throw the kcupin and this is the best hot choc ever i choke down my vitamins with it too worth it and so cheap here
3208,5,this is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates the kids love it quick and easyi will order this hot chocolate again
3209,5,kids loved it great product at a great price  my little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance
3210,3,even on the small cup setting of the elite these are a little weak for me  make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak  i also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them
3211,5,the hot chocolate is my husbands favorite  service was also great as it usually is  very popular now with winter coming on
3212,5,i like the rich dark smooth taste of the grove square cocoa it is the best i have found in kcups and i have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now delicious
3213,1,looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water no chocolate flavor whatsoever this was a complete disappointment  i got the hot chocolate kcups from swiss miss instead  how people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me is the amazon ratings system being gamed for this product
3214,5,excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule my fiancee fell in love with my brother in laws and had to have one now everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more also like the fact that theres a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from
3215,4,the kids love the hot cocoa and i like the fact that i can get the stuff shipped to me when i need it without worry of order
3216,5,this was the best purchase that i could have made for my daughter it was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books thanks so much
3217,4,as  a chocoholic for  many years i crave a good cup of hot chocolate  this done in the keurig is really easy and fast  the millk chocolatebr is tasty and the dark chocolate tastes like the many cups of cocoa i had as a child  not particularly carried away by the  peppermintbr flavor but it was not strong enough  to matter
3218,5,my family loves all three flavors the dark chocolate is my favorite  the price was unbeatable  i will buy this product again
3219,2,i found this too sweet am hoping theres an unsweetened version available not very chocolatey too kinda like swiss miss
3220,1,it has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache this should say light or diet to let the buyer know this i would have never bought it had i known it seems like it would taste good otherwise
3221,5,it tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar  i looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much a plus for me
3222,2,i have to admit based on most of the reviews i was sold on getting the  pack  was a mistake all three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose  that is the name of the artificial sweetner in the product  if you like splendayou may like this  but it has a distinct taste unfortunately not for me a few friends of mine that tried it and saidit wasnt bad unfortunately that was the best of the commentsbr if you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try cafe escapes or swiss miss  both are twice as good in my opinion liked the escapes best  wish i liked the artificial sweetner but the that taste has a distinct after taste probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar if your going to order i would get the small pack to try it  better then throwing out   try cafe escapes and swiss miss and see for yourself
3223,5,this is the best hot cocoa product i have found for the keurig kcup brewer the others i have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup
3224,5,they have some really good hot chocolate i got a single pack before and it was so good that i reordered some more i like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee use a big cupbr br one thing to note these dont have a strainer inside the entire contents are meant to be used unlike the coffee kcups so it will feel empty once done i would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come outbr br also kids may not like the peppermint flavor but that is my favorite one if you dont want to get the variety pack they sell the individual flavors too
3225,5,i brew the  oz cups  and  makes it too thin its good at that point but adding some creamer whipped cream and or cinamin always improves it
3226,5,husband and grandaughter love this cocoa make it for them all the time as i drink my coffee my husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings
3227,5,these kcups are awesome  they taste no different personally i think better than those which are priced three times as much  i highly recommend this product
3228,5,i have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find grove square to be about the best of them all  i usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers my favorite being the sugar free caramel macchiato  by adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories
3229,5,the most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever yum it has the best price and taste for the keurig kcup brewer way better then at least  other peicer brandsweve tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery thanks
3230,3,makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop  not as sweet as i would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension  i guess i can add marshmallows
3231,4,arrived quick and ontime and what a great value definitely pleased with my purchase and will likely buy again 
3232,5,great option for excellent taste price and convenience a repeat customer on these we order these now in the  pack instead of getting at the grocery store
3233,5,grove square hot cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate not to much chocolate just the right mixture delicious i say a good cup of hot chocolate try grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate k cups for keurig coffee makers enjoy i did
3234,5,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on oz setting however its not the best ive ever tasted nor the worst its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you dont i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better
3235,5,this is a great buy  i love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste  it isnt messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup  would buy again
3236,5,yum  all the convenience you expect with a kcup with all the flavor of real hot chocolate  the kids love it and so will you
3237,5,i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate  the kids love the flavor too  i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers  this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones  no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way
3238,5,this is one of my wifes favorite grove square has another great product to share with kcup users  now we need some specials  to bring the price per unit down
3239,5,my husband and i both love this hot chocolate we are on the auto shipment for every other month and we are going to have to change it to every month
3240,5,my family really enjoys grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate and we keep a supply on hand  the excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order
3241,5,i have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my keurig and this is by far the one i enjoy the most  i have it shipped every month so that i dont worry about running out
3242,5,i liked the milk chocolate version so tried this  it is just as good and with the more intense chocolate flavor appeals to my chocolate desires
3243,1,when i bought my keurig brewer i eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker  im still looking  the grove square hot cocoa had a nasty aftertaste almost metallic  no amount of cleaningtinkering with the brewer made any improvement  i used the brewer to make hot water for a nestle hot cocoa pack and that was a far superior beverage  the grove square quickly found its way to the trash  ill find quality mixes and use the keurig to heat the water from now on
3244,3,its okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste i actually find it to have a funky taste cant quite figure it out
3245,5,after trying several brands of hot cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them  im certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious but its also more affordable   boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly even with limits set  its also very convenient to have it shipped automatically  if we dont drink that much i simply skip a month  if friends come over and we drink a lot i just order an extra box  its quick simple and delicious
3246,4,to everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these kcups heres the trick  put it in your machine close the lid open the lid turn  degrees close the lid and repeat two more times  you should have closed the lid on the kcup four times by now  next step is to hit the brew button  the problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through  with the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good  would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to  could have been a little thicker overall but not bad
3247,5,the greatest best chocolate taste in any keurig kcups out there will definitely order more everyone in the office tries to steal them im a chocolate nut and these pass the test
3248,5,i have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the grove square milk chocolate kcups have by far been the best  theyre big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up  i would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand
3249,5,great product for keurig coffee maker works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures is good for just hot chocolate like purchase price
3250,5,i enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far  my sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but i am glad i brought the variety pack anyway
3251,5,this hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates i have tried  it is not watery  i have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both
3252,5,so far grove square has the best hot chocolate kcups  we have tried a couple others but they dont compare
3253,4,when i was talking to a neighbor about getting a keurig she told me not to get cocoa  this was in a group of beverages that i got when i ordered my keurig and i think it is very good  it is rich creamy and exactly what i want when i want a cup of cocoa  i would order this again
3254,5,this hot chocolate is very good it has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor the price is a very good deal and more than worth it
3255,5,i dont ven know why i ordered these it was just on a whim but what a surprise when i brewed myself some hot chocolate the taste was unbelievable just like homemade maybe a tad too sweet but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick love it
3256,3,i was expecting something more considering the keurig does such a good job with coffeebr but this stuff everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like nestles powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water watery sugary and nothing special
3257,5,this item has an awesome chocolate flavor i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses kcups great product
3258,1,i was hoping this was a good idea  however we tried them even after i heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true  not the same as the stuff from the can
3259,5,ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning very easy and fast to prepare in kcups
3260,3,i saw these on sale so i nabbed them  for anything larger than a oz cup the results will be too weak  i end up brewing one with oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of itbr br the peppermint was the flavor i was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that i loved the most  im on the fence about ordering hot cocoa kcups in the future  it might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my keurig
3261,4,the grove square hot coco kcups have a good flavor but i find that the kcups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup thus i recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right
3262,5,after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate my kids love it so i tried it and its the best i had in a while i will be ordering more
3263,5,a pleasant surprise awaited me when i first ordered grove square milk chocolate hot cocoa cups not a coffee drinkerbr i use our keurig kcup brewer mostly to make cocoa and a few other brands i tried simply did not hit the mark grove square cocoa tasted fullflavored with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink the first experience made me anticipate with pleasure the next time i popped a grove square kcup into the machine
3264,5,grove street has the absolute best hot chocolate for the keurig  you should always have hot chocolate available to soothe away the days anxieties
3265,5,my mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate add a little bit of milk afterwards and  splenda and the taste is amazing
3266,5,i was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad and had a really bad sucralose flavor i dont know if im just not as picky as others or what it is but i thought this hot cocoa was really good creamy and rich and almost too sweet i dont think it has an aftertaste though how some have described i used the middle water setting on my keurig or small mug oz i guess everyone has their own tastes and preferences but as for me i really like this product
3267,5,this is hands down the best tasting kcup hot chocolate available  the cafe escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial while this one tastes thicker and milkier  i love the dark chocolate flavor although if i didnt know it wasnt dark i probably couldnt have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa  i will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option  these are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool  everyone always wants hot chocolatebr br something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about  oz per kcup  i use  kcups per mug and the flavor is much better than when i try one too watery
3268,5,my grandson loves this  he makes a cup everytime he stops over it quick and easy and the taste is good
3269,5,as far as single serve cocoas go this is one of the best  i wouldnt say its as good as some of the handmade ones but its still good
3270,4,nice variety pack has  dofferent hot chocolates in one package milk dark and peppermint nice holiday feel good for company during the season
3271,4,we received this order in perfect condition i purchased this product for my motherinlaw she likes the convenience of the product in the keurig coffee maker the chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags overall it tastes pretty good it is a little weak but good use only on the small cup setting in the keurig  stars
3272,5,i bought this because it was a very good price  it was really good though  i love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoabr br will keep buying this until they dont sell it anymore it is really creamy  i like it best with  ounces of water gives it a thicker feel
3273,4,i was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes i received had already expired  luckily enough the flavors had not yet degradedbr br i specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor  i was hoping for more  the peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors
3274,5,i keep this on hand for the young at heart  we enjoy a cup almost every night  good taste  will buy again
3275,1,so if you are a person who likes swiss miss  hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station so do not get this product  i can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever  it just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that  this product has a strong fake sugar taste and i am perfectly ok with diet sodas and other fake sugar products  there is something about this i just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl  i even waited for it to cool down but it got worse  very disapointed in this product and it was not what i was expecting at all
3276,4,this is delicious hot chocolate it is best at  oz cup but can be stretched to  and oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha
3277,5,ive had many hot cocoa kcups and i must say this one is the best by far the green mountain one has a half  half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk
3278,5,i really like this hot chocolate mix  i was concerned when i read some of the reviews that i would not like it but i like it alot  to me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet  i would recommend this product
3279,1,all this is is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a kcup delivery device  what a waste of money  also grove square products are notoriously inferior
3280,3,my kids like this cocoa but i find flavor less delicious than the more expensive a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvqxymqgreen mountain coffee hot cocoa count kcups for keurig brewers pack of a
3281,2,very easy to use not the best flavor it has too much sugar and is not a quality i thought i was getting
3282,5,the hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size i find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa  the best bang for the buck i have so far found for hot cocoa  i tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee
3283,5,very good hot chocolate  i have tried a few different brands and this one is the best i have tried  should be priced higher for the quality you get
3284,5,ive been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and its one of the best ive had  i even got my inlaws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it  great price great product
3285,5,just what i was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out i love the flavor not so sweet and just right thank you and will be buying again
3286,3,my oh my is this cocoa sweet too sweet id say youre better off making hot cocoa from scratch i bought this because i thought the minty flavor would be good but its too sweet so are the dark and milk chocolate flavors
3287,5,i was a little skeptical when i bought this but it has really been a great purchase  the cocoa is delicious  its so easy to just make my daughter and i some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie  i didnt have to add anything to it but i did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down  i would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again
3288,4,i didnt read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it  calories and  grams of carbohydrate in each cup i tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty ill keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional minisplurge id like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future
3289,4,this is really tasty hot chocolate  i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference
3290,5,good value for the money these are good the hot cocoa is excellent however dont get the coffee cuz its instant
3291,5,not bad at all when i use coffeemate chocolate creamerbr i still like swiss mix made with  milk a little betterbr but as far kcups go this milk chocolate with the coffeemate chocolate creamer is not badbr and currently it is less than  for  cups
3292,5,my boyfriend and i really like these k cups we have tried others and they were kind of gross these are the ones we will stick with cant go wrong
3293,4,this is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the oz setting on your coffee make otherwise it will taste watered down also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it
3294,3,the product is not bad but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor  definitely an aftertaste watery
3295,2,a hot chocolate packet was the first kcup on my new keurig it was  am and i wasnt ready for coffee before bed i had read they ran a little watery but i decided to try it on the  oz setting took a sip and tossed it the next morning i made one with  oz and added some whipped cream the taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery my husband made one to try at  oz and said it tasted like sugar water i might try combining   oz servings to use the box up but we wont be buying more
3296,4,a good cup of hot chocolatewith a couple of marshmellows  make it for my daughter every time she visits she is nearly  and she loves it
3297,5,all three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste peppermint is our favorite we enjoy a cup after dinner flavored with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night its become a tasty habit
3298,4,this item had a great price and tastes great the only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable
3299,4,my husband and i really like this cocoa  i add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor but the convenience cannot be beat
3300,5,great deal especially for the price item arrived quicker than anticipated this has saved me many trips to dunkin doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate thats just as good looking for more to stockpile
3301,5,love them hardly notice any aftertaste from sweetener i dont agree with some of the others that didnt like itwill buy again
3302,3,this product is nice and the price is right but it isnt swiss chocolate for surebr br just doesnt have that real deep chocolate taste
3303,3,i bought this brand of hot chocolate k cups cause it had the best review on amazon at the time  the kids love it  they especially like the peppermint flavor which i cant see any other way to get except in this mixed box  you get milk chocolate dark chocolate and peppermint flavors  i tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste  i make it on the lowest setting on my keurig which i think is around  ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them  if you like a strong chocolate flavor this isnt it
3304,5,wow what a deal these taste just as good as the expensive brands most definately will be buying these again
3305,4,i feel like ive tried every hot cocoa there is in the kcups  while i do think this is the best hot cocoa so far it still isnt great  im not sure what it is but all of the cocoa kcups seem to have a weird taste to them  its almost like there is artificial sweetener in them but i know there is notbr i set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa  this has more body to it than othersbr im still waiting and hoping that dunkin donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a kcup  there really is nothing better than thatbr if you want a kcup hot cocoa i would def recommend this over all the others
3306,3,i hate sucralosebr br honestly i dont know how other people cant taste it when its in sweetened products its got this unpleasant fake flavor that i just cant ignore i think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertisingbr br that being said it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the cafe escapes hot cocoa and as such i have to give it higher marks than the competitionbr br still i cant believe this product and its nearest competitor use sucralose but dont say theyre a diet lite lowsugar or otherwise unnaturallysweetened product its frustrating i can taste the stuff and i really dislike it i also dont like the chemical makeup of sucralose but i wont go into that here just believe me natural sugar is way better for you in the long runbr br theres one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a kcup and thats swiss miss unfortunately the swiss miss kcups are ridiculously high priced and hard to findbr br my opinion its probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets and use the hot water function of your keurig its not worth the kcup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices spending more than seventyfive cents per cup of waterbased hot cocoa is about the limit for mebr br so if youre into sucralosesplenda then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly notsugar flavor if youre like me though and cant stand that artificial stuff then avoid this product and find another optionbr br three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywherebr br update  i just found out that the swiss miss kcups also use sucralose so really your only choice is to get packets and use your keurig as a hot water dispenser how disappointingbr br update  after some research i found that there is one kcup hot cocoa that doesnt have sucralose however it is loaded with fructose instead not the greatest tradeoff since it tastes different from sugarsucrose in my opinion and has no actual sugarsucrose in it that one is green mountain coffee hot cocoa unfortunately reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil and is on the salty side so i have avoided it its also more expensive percup and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twentyfive cents as opposed to a box of  packets being around two dollars then go ahead and try it i will refrain at this point and stick to using packetsbr br i would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say the cafe escapes hot cocoa kcups swiss miss hot cocoa kcups and grove square hot cocoa kcups all use sucralose yes there is sugar in some of those but it is in addition to sucralosesplenda and not by itselfbr br so your choices right now are pure sucralose sucralose plus a sugar or pure fructose none of them is appetizing to me and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasantbr br  servings of sugarsweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks and its no more complicated than a kcup if you know how to operate a spoon
3307,5,these grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really goodbr br dark chocolate  my favorite very good even on the large cup settingbr milk chocolate  excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup settingbr peppermint  everyone likes this one on either cup size settingbr br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar i dont notice the taste but my wife does but she still likes thembr br highly recommendedbr br cfh
3308,5,excellent product a tip from the keurig people shake the kcup before using it this prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor
3309,4,i have read some really funny reviews about this product  some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup so therefore it must have been an instant mix  brilliant deduction sherlock  what did you expectto see chocogrounds in the cup  yes it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route thats why  instead of  starsbr br but the taste is what you want to know about right  the dark chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little grittyness to it  plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and youll have a real treat  it comes out strong enough on either the  oz or  oz setting of the brewer  not surprisingly the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother  marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too  so maybe a few minimarshmallows instead of a fullsized one for this flavor  oh and definitely go  oz cup  my oldest granddaughter and i contest for the peppermint chocolate  she wins of course but its pretty good when i can get one  no marshmallow needed  the hint of peppermint is just enough   oz cup on this one is the best way to go toobr br i think i got the cups sizes right  if i didnt youll figure it out  btw id imagine the reason its always out of stock is because people keep buying it  ive dipped into the supply well a few times myself  pretty good pretty cheap pretty hard to get at times  ill buy it again
3310,5,everyone in my family likes hot cocoa i was running plain water through my kcup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didnt really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow so i decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time no overflow the taste is good its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids i will be ordering this product from now on for my familybr in the interest of product comparison we have ordered timothys white hot chocolate and green mountain hot cocoa timothys was great but pricy and green mountain didnt really taste all that great to our family it had a watered down taste to it
3311,4,when i weigh the convenience of a k cup against the price and the taste i would characterize these as a winner not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet these are pretty darn good they nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that ive had with some other brands do not select  oz on your machine though make it only at  or  oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion all in all a fine cup of hot chocolate
3312,5,i am actually surprised at how good this product is i am a cuisinart keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year roundbr br price point the price for these at the store  exact brand  is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use in comparison to other more expensive brands its a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantitybr br flavor wise my kids love it and have already asked me to purchase more my daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup i love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha  oz coffee to  oz chocolate  and its much better than some other brands that i have tried in the pastbr br overall impression  great value good flavor excellent price point i will be purchasing more
3313,5,ordered on a whim  my first grove square purchase  great for the familys occasional cocoa desire  being a kcup its fast and easy  was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee so far so good  great cup of dark rich cocoa  maybe could taste a little better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk  the ease and simplicity and lack of clean up make this a better option for me  will order again  nice to see it on subscribe and save
3314,5,my box of grove square hot cocoa arrived today and ive just tried it delicious made a big cup by mistake but im happy with the flavor and consistency  no off tastes that i can discern  a little disappointed at high sodium content nice to have as fall starts to chill
3315,2,i really really dislike sucralose  i dont like the taste the aftertaste or the after effects  i bought this based on it not saying it was diet or low calorie  the first ingredient is sugar so its only partially sweetened with sucralose  sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeablebr br sure wish amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products
3316,5,ok  this is not the finest european chocolate  but you can make it in your keurig and all  flavors taste good  ive joined the club and get the lowest possible cost  no charge to join and no effort to quit  why not  its nice to have when youre dieting because its just enough chocolate to keep you on track  nondieters will like it for the convenience
3317,5,ive tried a few different hot cocoa brands for my keurig and have been disappointed every time until now cocoa brews smooth and full flavoredon either the small cup size or the medium i add a splash of almond milk and im ready to go  perfect ill definitely buy this again
3318,4,i recieved a keurig kcup brewer for christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so i tried this brand and i like them but i havent tried other brands yet to compare with i would buy these again until i find one i like better
3319,4,i see a lot of complaints about grove square hot chocolate i think it tastes ok considering its a kcup not homemade and not gourmet i dont have anything negative to say the company or the product its relatively inexpensive and the company didnt falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste
3320,4,i really like hot cocoa  i like it sooo much that i have a cocoa latte machine which is great but sometimes i just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher  when that happens i used to put on the kettle and heat up the water then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir and stir and stir  and after all that stirring id still get little lumps in my cocoa  with the kcups i get smooth rich cocoa with no lumps and no cleanup  easy and yummybr br please note these are not sugarfree  the very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and i did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients  each cup has only  calories but if you want sugarfree or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you
3321,5,very good hot cocoa  and price was rightbr br awesome and passing the word on the item  will buy it again
3322,5,the thing i like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once i remove it from the keurig it doesnt leak all over the place  for some reason all the hot chocolates ive purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot  my coffee doesnt do that so not sure why that is  this is a great deal for the amount you get as well and taste yummy
3323,5,i found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best ive had for my keurig  i will continue to order this particular brand
3324,5,i love these hot chocolates i think theyre way better than the cafe express hot chocolates these and the swiss miss hot chocolate are my favorite kcups and the price of these are the best ive been able to find my girlfriend and i have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks and i never used to drink much hot chocolatebr i recommend these
3325,5,i really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half  half for creaminess being that i am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea the local stores sell this as well but its half the amount of cups and almost the same price buy from amazon
3326,4,i like to brew a kcup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha  this dark chocolate flavor is quite nice especially mixed with double black diamond coffee  though not the very best it is good and the price is right compared to other brands
3327,1,since i am willing to try alot of new things i thought that i would buy this product and since i do like hot cocoa i bought  boxes worst thing i could have done this is bland with very little flavour it also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mugbr personally i will not buy this product again i will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the keurig kcup
3328,3,does not have a rich chocolate flavor tastes a little watery not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it
3329,4,taste was decent a little sugary but very creamy otherwise very happy with this product i will be buying this product again packaging interesting as its a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house
3330,5,grove square hot chocolate is the best kcup hot chocolate i read many reviews before making this purchase and now i agree and will continue to buy this brand
3331,4,my kids have been begging for hot cocoa kcups and when i found these so reasonably priced i decided to give them a try  we all loved them
3332,2,this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesnt taste very chocolatey the name brand cocoa kkups are better or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better
3333,4,all three tastes rich and chocolaty not chalky at all we were surprised how good they are better than any other kcup cocoa weve tried
3334,1,just plain nasty this item tasted like cardboard very watered down and no flavor to it at all  very disappointed
3335,5,this brand is by far the best k cup hot cocoa not that that says much but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest
3336,2,thin runny and the fake milk powder used to add creaminess has an off flavor better off eating your ceramic mug
3337,5,you cant beat this deal  boxes of  kcups for little more then  no other store can even match that price for hot chocolate kcups your normally going to be paying around  for  kcups alone this package give you  kcups for a great pricebr br the hot chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the b except for the travel mug low in calories and great tasting defiantly a must have if you own a keurig brewing system
3338,4,not too sweet  the best kcup hot chocolate ive tried thus far the kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate
3339,5,grove square is the best kcup hot cocoa ive tried  and ive tried a number of the other brands  this tastes like real cocoa used to taste and if you add a little milk its even better its so hot from the keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway if your looking for a real chocolately flavor give this a try
3340,1,i dont expect great hot chocolate from a kcup but it should at least taste like theres some cocoa in it i cant believe how bad this stuff tastes i tried it  times and then threw the rest away
3341,5,best hot chocolate available for kcups best taste after taste great in any size when brewed highly recommend over any other company
3342,4,of the few hot cocoa flavors weve tried this is the best so far  it has the richest flavor and i dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on  its also very affordable compared to other kcups right now  i thought that the kcup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year but now i know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced
3343,5,this is the absolute best hot cocoa for the keurig brewers all of the other hot cocoas that we have tried we had to doctor to make them taste good we had to add more cocoa and more sugar i was pretty much making my own cocoa which defeated the purpose of the brewer but the grove square hot cocoa does not need any help in my opinion it has just the right amount of flavor
3344,5,oh so good the first cup i had was on the medium setting it was too sweet so i had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect this is a creamy hot chocolate add a little milk and and whipped cream and your set
3345,5,i was quite pleased with e flavor of this product a good strong yet not overpowering flavor  rich chocolate flavor very pleasing i highly recomend this product
3346,5,im giving this product  stars because i think it is great considering that it is made with water  the hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size  if you want a large cup of hot chocolate use  kcups  it is fairly low in calories most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little kcup
3347,2,i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews  the artificial sweetener taste is awful  i gave two stars only because my husband doesnt seem to mind  i cant drink this even if they were a bargain
3348,4,better than expected but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste this is a good purchase for the price
3349,1,i looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa but was very disappointed with the flavor it has an awful aftertaste like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda also kind of weak even on the smallest cup setting
3350,1,so bad i returned it my children didnt even like it and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food
3351,5,kcups are a godsend among kcups these are near the topbr br the keurig brewer is a blessing hot beverages in seconds mostly coffee but there are greater and lesses among the coffees and so it seems among the hot cocoasbr br this is so rich and vibrant it announces itself from two rooms away  silky smooth bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver its a musthave in this household
3352,5,this is the best hot cocoa i have tried for the keurig rich chocolate flavor i used the oz setting and it is not watery  if you like hot cocoa and the convenience of a kcup this is the one to get
3353,2,i bought this for my daughter and grandson they both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it therefore i will not buy it again
3354,2,the artificial sweetener ruined this for me it leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband who drinks diet soda even noticed at least it wasnt pricey
3355,5,grove square milk chocolate cocoa k cups are great i usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove i thought this was easier and delicious to add creaminess i put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped creamperfect
3356,5,i ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for christmas  he loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own  delivery was good i had it in several days but still in plenty of time for christmas  would recommend to anyone
3357,3,good flavors in this combo not really strong but i will just set the machine on less water next time
3358,5,love this brand great price with save and subscribe my husband loves them top with whipped cream in a can and i have a happy man i wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa
3359,4,great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa kcups have  ive tasted several and this by far is the better one but i have to say anything larger than oz tastes a bit watered down  will definitely purchase more but at the rate my family downs these we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective
3360,5,i ordered this as a christmas present for my daughter and son in law he tried it the day after christmas and gave it  thumbs up
3361,5,i bought a box of grove square hot cocoa because i love their cappuccino french vanilla  i used the medium cup setting and added some whipped creamit was to die for  very yummy and almost as good as homemade  i never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews but it could be because of the redi whip i added to it  i highly recommend it
3362,5,my wife rates this    stars she is the chocoholic in the family and if you please heryou please everybody 
3363,5,i love the flavor that this hot chocolate has  it is very rich and smooth  have tried other brands but did not get the results i wanted  i will definately be ordering from this company again
3364,5,got a brand new keurig machine for christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting kcups on the market i came across this when searching for some good hot cocoa and am amazed at how many kcups you really get out of this  kcups for about  when i purchased was a great deal when most hot chocolate prices were  kcups for br br this is a great deal and you get to try out peppermint dark chocolate and milk chocolate its light on calories and most important of all taste greatbr br must have if your a hot chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make great tasting hot chocolate for less
3365,5,fantastic cocoa  all the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate  i received my keurig as a christmas present and i am loving cocoa at the end of the work dayno mixing no microwave and positively no pot on the stovejust warm chocolatey goodness on demand will order this product again
3366,4,after trying many of the other hot cocoa kcup options i find that the grove square product tastes the best  for my personal taste i find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste  just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat  however this is not hot chocolate which may be a turn off for some tasters
3367,5,i have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet  very nice flavor doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates  very impressed
3368,5,i enjoy a good cup of hot cocoa on occasion and this is good stuff  not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on kcups this product is very reasonable in price
3369,5,i bought these for my mom and she loves it  she mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate  she enjoyed melting pepermint candies in too
3370,5,i bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one  the peppermint was pretty good as wellgood cocoa
3371,1,i tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before i bought it but couldnt find anything online turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists and yet that didnt help the taste at all it is awfulbr br i had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldnt find any takers i finally got rid it of it at the christmas white elephant gift exchange at work i put it with a nice cookbook which was the real present and wrapped it real prettily unfortunately the boss ended up with it i havent asked him if his family enjoyed it because i dont want to put him on the spot judging by the reviews there are a lot of people who like it  hopefully he will too maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove with milk cocoa and sugar and maybe a tiny pinch of salt  compared to that this stuff tastes like a chemical experimentbr br anyway instead of trying one of the other brands i now heat some milk in the microwave stir in a couple spoonfuls of hersheys cocoa and some sugar to taste it takes about three minutes and its delicious now where did i put those minimarshmallows
3372,5,sometimes id rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work this meets my cocoa craving i do not need to add sugar  just add water and brew
3373,5,everything youd want from a hot chocolatecreamy milky tasty makes you happy  i cant wait to try the other flavors
3374,5,i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best  now i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product
3375,5,having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate kcups grove squares are by far the best  they are very chocolaty rich creamy and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup  yum
3376,5,i must say i was pleasantly surprised i dont drink coffee and i was searching for more hot chocolates for my keurig i am a milk chocolate fan but with grove square the peppermint and dark chocolate are by far the better choiceboth have a sweetness i wasnt expecting the flavor is great and i dont want to share i am definitely reordering more
3377,5,this is by far the best hot cocoa i have found yet for the keurig i love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite i would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa kcups all the other selections for hot cocoa that i have tried were just okay tasting these are amazing love them i will order these for sure again
3378,2,i just got a keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee  i didnt have super high expectations but these are absolutely awful  there is a very strong plasticchemical taste to these kcups  i tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help  the only reason i gave these kcups  stars is because my boyfriend can tolerate them but i dont trust him because hell eat just about anything  in his opinion they are not that good but he will still drink the mugbr br from what ive read of other hot chocolate kcups youd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way
3379,5,after being disgusted by the brown water created by the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa we were thrilled to find these dark chocolate cocoa kcups  delicious
3380,5,this is the best keurig kcup hot chocolate you can buy ive tried others but will never buy any other brand again
3381,4,this hot chocolate tasted very good  the whole family liked it  it is a nice change to make hot chocolate instead of coffee inthe keurig coffee maker  we wold purchase this again
3382,5,we had previously tried another brand of hot coca kcups we bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value we actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried they have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness we like the variety of flavors in the pack also
3383,5,i am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for keurig  previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only soso but this is definitely better  the variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest  i never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over  move over coffee lovers we cocoa drinkers have found a home
3384,4,i have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average  unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips
3385,5,ive heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their keurig kcup brewers  the search is over  this grove square hot cocoa received four big smiles from my sons they just went on and on about how delicious it was  i love having this new coffee pot where its fast and convenient for all of us  super happy with this purchase
3386,4,reasonable in price tastes good  prefect for keurig which can be pricey  we will probably buy this again  it is mostly for the kiddos anyway
3387,5,these are so nice and creamy  usually i dont justify buying kcups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet but this is so convenient and very good tasting  way better than most powdered cocoa packets ive tried  as far as price comparison it is equivalent to gourmettypes of cocoa that would easily cost  per packet  i also like that it comes in a variety pack with  flavor options  highly recommend
3388,4,i ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my keurig and i am very happy with this product i will definitely be ordering it again that being said i dislike hot chocolate made completely of water so i do add a splash of half and half to my cup when i make this thus i didnt want to give it a  star rating since i do doctor my cup up a bit at home otherwise i would have however i wont even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water i use  milk usually for those and they still dont measure up to this product from grove square so the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes i do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that i have ever tried at home compared to the swiss miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it im a big fan
3389,5,great product at a reasonable pricemy husbands favorite loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of  that includes light dark and peppermint also  shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa kcups we have tried in taste
3390,5,i bought this item for my elderly  mom to use with the new keurig coffee machine i purchased for her she loves iti will be ordering more
3391,5,bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great too bad i dont have one of those machines otherwise id try them out myself  i might have to consider getting one if you really like it you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you dont run out
3392,5,this is great hot chocolatenot watery like some others and my husband really likes this onethank you  pat greenough boise id
3393,5,we love this variety box in our house we subscribe to ensure we never run out  i use the dark to make mocha my wife loves the peppermint and i drink the milk whenever i fancy a hot chocolatebr br the dark makes a great mocha just do half a cup of the dark cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee add whipped cream on top delicious  also worth noting you can try some of the flavored coffees in your mocha and rustle up some great combos i am not a fan of flavored coffee i struggle to drink a cup but as a mocha delightfulbr br drinking the peppermint or milk as a hot chocolate we add a little milk and whipped cream on top deliciousbr br i highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it 
3394,2,well you get what you paid for while this milk chocolate kcup is pretty cheap  per   cents per count but it is not good it tasted like watered down chocolate as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolatecacao for that matter this thing is sweet tho in fact kinda too sweet for my taste i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugarsweetener i thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so i lowered the cup size from  ounce to  ounce on my keurig brewer and its the same thing
3395,5,ive tried ever single brand of kcup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one it is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff
3396,5,great price for the count my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day quick to receive
3397,4,it appears a little watery but the taste is not bad at all  if you have kids that are as fascinated by the keurig as you are theyll probably enjoy this
3398,5,i enjoy this cocoa very much the children love it and drink it often  i would purchase this product again
3399,5,for the price i think the cocoa cups are very good i will order them again they are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays
3400,5,great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas i have tasted in this type of single serve job well dont grove square
3401,5,this is the best cocoa ever it beats out anything you can buy in the store  sometimesbr i just mix it in my coffee and its wonderful  highly recommend
3402,4,its a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version no mess and the ss price is great i like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser
3403,3,i like it ok but it isnt anything great i have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost ill go back to that method and save my  for coffee
3404,4,this is actually better than i expected when i paid less than  cents each  we usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer  this is much easier and the taste is comparable  if you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick sweet chocolate flavored and warm for around  cents it is worth a try  i would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask
3405,4,getting really good cocoa out of a kcup is not easy but this is much better than the others i have tried still a little wattery but at  calories it is a nice treat  very rich flavor  not as good as the real thing bit i am not drinking it in a berlin chocolate shop either  put your slippers on sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie and enjoybr br  cal  fat    g fat sat     carb    g sugar    ltg fiber
3406,5,this hot chocolate is great am so glad i doubled the order you can not miss with this now i have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids
3407,2,this is much too watery it tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine  after receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients  ive decided not to order again  this product if definitely not worth the money
3408,5,we recieved the product on time and in excellent shape it tastes good and meets our expectations thanks for the excellent service
3409,4,funny thing  i bought some of these kcups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time  i just got them last week and have had a few cups since then  im using  ounces of water to prepare the cocoa  i thought they tasted pretty good  reasonably chocolaty and smoothbr br they were sweet but not overly so and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box   calories  hey not too bad  it wasnt until now that i came back to place a review and i read the most recent reviews from others did i realize they use artificial sweetener  honestly if i hadnt read it i would have never known  i didnt detect anything that gave me the hint when i drank itbr br i think if you like a quick cocoa on the run youll be happy enough with these kcups  are they as good as a swiss miss packet from costco  maybe not but in my office i dont want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed  youll sacrifice a little for the convenience but to me its well worth it
3410,3,unfortunately i am conflicted with my purchasebr br although the final product was quite good  stars the quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star i opened the amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the grove square packaging i opened it to find that  of the kcups werent sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box i inspected both the amazon package and the grove square both of which had no visible exterior damagebr br i was disappointed with both grove square for the quality of their product and as a result i am not sure i would buy this product again
3411,5,everything about the order went great the hot chocolate is very good i will be ordering this again probaly soon
3412,3,the flavor of this cocoa is good but i found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water the second cup was better when i used less water
3413,4,i am amazed how well these little cups taste  these kcups taste very well  this hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute
3414,5,i recently purchased a keurig and i bought the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste  i saw the grove square brand and thought i would give it a try since i got  kcups for less than the  from keurig i received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it  the cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the cafe escapes i will be ordering this one again and i hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it
3415,2,with a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbqxwgreen mountain hot cocoaa being perpetually out of stock in the winter i thought id give the cheaper grove square brand a shotbr br since the kcup patents are starting to sunset grove square is one of the first unofficial producers of we cant legally call these kcups but they work in your keurigrtm coffee maker pods and i thought that id be getting the same overall quality without the licensing fees tacked on to the pricebr br well i was right about grove square being cheaper but i think thats the nicest i can bebr br as others have pointed out theres a definite diet or a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbelbxksplendaa aftertaste this hadnt been reviewed yet when i bought it so i didnt see the warnings from others and rechecked the ingredients several times to make surebr br well its got  calories which seems a bit lower than green mountain but a bit high for something that dietconscious people would want and the ingredient list didnt seem to point to obvious diet sweetenersbr br the overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugarfree tootsie roll in your hot water using the normal cup setting going one size down didnt seem to improve much beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter  but that just meant a heavier shot of lowcalorie sweetener to the taste budsbr br the way i see it i saved about  by going with this brand on the other hand now ive got  of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if i cant sucker someone er please my discerning guests with a few cupsbr br if you drink diet soft drinks by choice youre probably going to like this
3416,5,we have tried many of the different hot cocoa kcupseverything always tasted so watered down even when using the smallest setting on the machine  however this brandeven at the medium cup setting tasted fantastic  i highly recommend grove square  i havent tried any of their other products but i would be inclined to now based on this cocoa
3417,5,these grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really goodbr br dark chocolate  my favorite very good even on the large cup settingbr milk chocolate  excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup settingbr peppermint  everyone likes this one on either cup size settingbr br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar i dont notice the taste but my wife does but she still likes thembr br highly recommended we tried these in the smaller variety pack a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkqkgrove square hot cocoa cups variety pack kcups for keurig brewers count pack of abr br cfh
3418,1,this tastes terrible  like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate  the best i have tried so far is swiss miss hot chocolate kcups  dont think they are sold on amazon yet
3419,2,had i known this cocoa was sugarfree i would not have purchased it i realize that this will not bother some people but i really dont like the aftertaste of fake sugar  in the interest of fairness this did not seem to trouble my nephew  just update the description
3420,2,my whole family people tasted all  flavors and they are sickly sweet  very disappointed that product has sucralose  i wouldnt buy it again
3421,2,using  oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak it was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup using  oz made the cocoa much too sweet and still too weak in the chocolate department it uses sucralose as a sweetener which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor this may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or dont mind the taste of sucralose unfortunately im not one of those people
3422,5,perhaps not your grandmas cup of hot chocolate but for the keurig its the best out there  and what makes it a sweeter deal you get  packs for the typical price of  kcup box take note its a pack of  so a total of  kcupsbr br i suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much but decide for yourself
3423,5,truthfully i wasnt expecting too much with this but thought i would give it a try for something different for my keurig i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised at how good this is  my favorite is the dark chocolate but the peppermint is very good as well  i am not a real milk chocolate fan but i mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good i would definitely purchase this again
3424,4,as you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge well this hot chocolate is quite good the flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it i made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it  will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder
3425,4,although this isnt a perfect cup of cocoa its far superior to the others that i have tried i will order this again
3426,5,this is by far the best kcup hot cocoa we have tried  it has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a kcup it is easy to have a cup anytime you like highly recommend
3427,5,out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that i have tried this is by far the best one not weird aftertaste and not watered down tastes amazing and priced fairly what more could you ask for
3428,5,these kcups are just what my son wanted  the price was excellent and the flavor is rich  i would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa
3429,5,i am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa i would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and its perfect for those cold fall or winter days warms you up plus tastes great
3430,1,cant tell you how this tastes because i read the ingredients first but it has transfats in every flavor  the seller should disclose all ingredients in the description i wouldnt have purchased this otherwise
3431,1,i received my order of grove square hot cocoa mix today and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix i have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels i would urge amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale if the ingredients had been listed those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products
3432,5,i mainly use my keurig for coffee but thought id try this one since i love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews  ive tried some other chocolate kcups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery  if i can taste water i dont consider it real hot chocolate  i was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others ive tried  i must admit there are many i havent tried but i dont really feel like making a big scientific study of it  this will be my source of hot chocolate from now onbr br i was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains  that sort of thing worries me a little  still i dont drink hot chocolate that much so i think ill survive  ill copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition infobr br calories  from fat   trans fat g sodium mg sugars gbr br ingredients sugar glucose syrup solids cocoa processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm andor canola modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors cellulose gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphate sucralose mono and diglycerides silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial color contains milk and soybr br i always hate seeing artificial coloring in dark chocolate productsbr br if i had hot chocolate every day i would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals but since i enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my keurig on the occasional whim ill just keep a box of these kcups on hand  i highly recommend it for the taste it isnt easy finding good hot chocolate
3433,1,this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you usei is just not good
3434,1,when i got my keurig i fell in love i bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa im a bit of a hot cocoa nut partially because i cant have caffeine and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards i really wanted to love this hot cocoa i tried all three flavors multiple times in different ways i tried them on the different cup sizes adding things etc theres just this strange taste to them that doesnt sit well on the tongue im not sure what it is but it has a faint ring of sour milk it really lingers and i havent found anything that takes the taste away im going to give my second box to a friend she doesnt seem to notice it my daughter and husband both said it tasted weird so its not just me i also took it to a friends house and have tried them in three different keurig machines just to make sure mine didnt need to be descaled so i guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes
3435,1,i ordered this product because of a good price deal  amazon shipped accordingly absolutely no problems there  however the taste of this product was horrendous  it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it  i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water cheaper and much better tasting
3436,1,this has to be without a doubt the worst tasting hot chocolate ever the best way to describe the taste of this stuff is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate swiss miss instant is way better and cost less after only  cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this slop
3437,3,this is okay cocoa its not really very smooth and its a little watery i had high hopes as i love dark chocolate hot cocoa and the reviews were good i will finish the box i bought but will try another brand next time
3438,3,just got a new keurig and was looking for a great chocklate drinkstill lookingthis is fair at bestwatery and nothing to brag about
3439,4,i havent actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but i know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the van houtte mexican coffeeim ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee  been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better  i usually have  oz at a time so i run  oz through as hot chocolate and the other  as coffee i did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasnt as good as this brand
3440,5,we have a new hot beverage cooker this thing is the closest thing to the futuristic replicators made know via star trek movies and series of various effortsbr br we love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higherend unit to our own home environmentbr br weve used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years but this kit tops that experiencebr br i especially like the hotchocolate and tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee optionsbr br do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station
3441,5,id never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on amazon and i was extremely surprised at how good the dark chocolate hot cocoa is  absolutely worth trying its really quite good
3442,3,this is the best hot cocoa i have found so far but i hope i can find better its not real chocolately wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole i would buy it again if i cant find better
3443,5,this is really great hot chocolate the price is right too usually i find that hot chocolate kcups are weak or watery but not this one i was impressed the dark chocolate is really yummy i will be ordering more
3444,3,fortunately before i purchased i read through enough reviews of these kcups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar  im shocked that the item descriptions dont make this clear  i consider that important informationbr br i decided to give them a try anyway considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell  i realize that many products do this recently but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertastebr br sadly this one does too  its close  i can almost enjoy a cup  but its still unmistakable especially if you dont consume much artificial sweetener  i chew sugarfree gum and thats it for mebr br its a shame too because the chocolate flavor is nice  in fact i rated these a  simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them  and i was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before i found out about the sweetenerbut now i wont be buying any  side note many cappuccino reviewers complained that theyre instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino  that would be fine with me if it werent for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos dont havebr br if they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener id buy it but until then im staying away from grove square products
3445,5,we use our keurig every day  when a friend gave us a sample we went crazy it is the best hot chocolate ever  i highly recommend this it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert
3446,1,i guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesnt mention that the first ingredient is trans fat partially hydrogenated oil  had i know i would not have purchased this  consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients
3447,1,please stay away from artificial sweetnersbr br some of them actually change the shape of human cellsbr br this has an artificial sweetner
3448,1,ive been excitedly trying every type of k cup i can get my hands on since i got my keurig for christmas and until now have not encountered any that i truly hate until i discovered this one i would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at grove square certainly did a good job not only was the hot chocolate watery but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also yuck
3449,1,i ordered this specifically bc they said dark chocolate so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor they taste very watery even using the lowest amount of water on the keurig the nutritional fact show that it only has  grams of sugar  where the normal store bought powder has  grams i didnt like these at all if youre going for something low sugar they might be for you
3450,2,i read all the reviews on every hot chocolate kcup on the market and decided to try this one first its not good even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct plasticy taste i think that this an inherent problem with all the kcup hot chocolates you just cant fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesnt taste watered down im going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way
3451,2,this hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products  we tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone well be going back to the cafe escapes brand
3452,3,just tried this for the first time today  they are ok but they do have an odd aftertaste  not sure ill be ordering these again  also  the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle without a kcup after making them i assume to clean the machine out
3453,5,compared to other kcup products grove square offers tasty products at a reasonable price  this hot cocoa was rich and delicious
3454,1,i ordered the dark hot cocoa in hopes it would be real chocolatey and it was no better than buying a pouch of hot chocolate and adding it to hot water i actually think the pouch added to hot water is loads better and a whole lot cheaper very diappointed for the priceits a ripoff
3455,2,the cocoa wasnt too bad the taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes  i was disappointed though when i went to a local store and saw it for less than what i paid just for shipping  i really thought i was getting a good deal until i went home and checked the ticket  i just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house so disapppointed
3456,1,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredientsbr no real peppermint is in this product and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either
3457,1,i cant believe i didnt check out the ingredients for this  i never would have bought it if i would have known there was artificial sweetener in it  first cup though i got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote  if you dont have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems you may like it  not worth it to us
3458,2,found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too  they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod  kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging so we switched back to packets
3459,5,great hot chocolate by far the best kcup hot chocolate i have found i use a little milk or half and half and its so good i definitely will order again thanks for the super fast shipping
3460,5,my whole family loves this product often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have some members of my family have severe nut allergies  this product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are
3461,4,unlike some others this is actually in a k cup and not just an overpriced version of swiss miss  while the flavor is not super premium like a godiva or ghiradhelli it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak k cup versions ive had  the sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix but it isnt unpleasantbr br i like to brew this on the smallest setting oz and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave i think that gives a richer taste the peppermint is my favorite followed by the dark and then the light chocolate  they are all very good  my only wish is that i could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only
3462,4,these are the only kind of cocoa kcups i have tried as i have a fairly new machine my only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost however i usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great the peppermint and dark chocolate kcups are delicious definitely worth a shot for this great price
3463,5,whole family liked all three flavors  weve had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldnt get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate  the  price was right on these for sure but i was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand  but its just hot chocolate so i figured what the heck  all three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving  honestly i think theyre a little bit better than the other brands weve had
3464,5,what i really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates  my favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate  the milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well the price through amazon is very reasonable
3465,5,very good hot chocolate  nice rich flavor  we used the smallest setting on our keurig and made sure to shake it to make sure the powder was loose in the kcup the kcup was completely empty after brewing there is sucralose in it but i could not detect the aftertaste of it  im pretty sensitive to that aftertaste i will buy this product againbr br here are facts on the boxbr br calories  fat saturatedg sodium mg carbs g fiber ltg sugars g protein g if its not listed it is br br the ingredients list for this isbr sugar glucose syrup solid cocoa processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm andor canola nonfat dry milk modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors cellulose gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphatesucralose mono and diglycerides silicone dioxide silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial color contains milk and soy
3466,4,the price is wonderful the hot cocoa tastes great in  and  oz but oz was a bit watery to mebr dark chocolate yumbr milk chocolate is very yummybr peppermint for me wasnt enough peppermint but i just add a candy cane to minebr   i would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon
3467,1,we prefer the swiss miss brand kcup  this one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate this is my least favorite of all kcup brands
3468,1,nice price and glad to see a subscribe  save option on kcups however this was undrinkable in our opinion didnt seem to be too watery like another reviewer said just a bad off taste
3469,3,i think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery my wife is a big swiss miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa not sure i will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups sometimes i think you are better off buying swiss miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine
3470,4,unlike the other hot chocolates this one does not have that obnoxious after taste  what a relief  when i purchased my keurig it came with a box of  hot chocolate kcups name not used to protect the guilty that have the most indescribable particularly unpleasant after taste all due to the fake sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the productbr br this manufacturer does use some sucralose but no where near the amount that other uses  in fact it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping  whoohoobr br will be ordering more  thank you for my kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation
3471,5,what a fun winter treat  this is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds  we like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing a family favorite
3472,5,was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a k cup but grove square is amazing  it is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss  the milk chocolate is mild the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner
3473,5,i love these the price is very goodall the flavors are really good the peppermint one is my favorite and i would gladly take more of that before the others though the others arent lacking at all im just a peppermint fan will be buying more when my others get low thanks so much
3474,5,i like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others i have triedjust bought some more of thesea hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkqvigrove square single serve hot cocoa cups milk kcups for keurig brewers countaacocoa
3475,5,i was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items ive purchased for the keurig have been awful i was pleasantly pleased with this  it is simply delicious  i will definitely reorder
3476,4,this is a really great kcup cocoa i had been drinking the cafe express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy  nice creamy chocolate flavor so i switched to this i found it at walmart but this price is better  here for the  pack give it a try 
3477,5,for those who do not drink coffee this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your keurig
3478,5,super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have foundbr br i am glad i found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits br br love it
3479,3,i didnt expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup but heres a tip put on oz setting then add a  ratio of heated milk it tastes amazingly goodbr br of course if you add a little baileys irish cream it tastes even better
3480,5,we have bought several types brands of hot cocoa k cups these our definitely one of the best they have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them even my  year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this it is creamy it actually tasted like a melted candy bar very good taste not watered down like some of them of course the price is amazing but dont let that fool you this is one of those products that is actually good even though it isnt very expensive
3481,5,wow i did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a kcup hot chocolate and of course taste is something that is very subjective  if you read all the reviews on every product youll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation  so i decided that even with some bad reviews id try this one since it has a lot of good reviews  im just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread  some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute or some such thing  all i can tell you is i must have underachieving taste buds because all i can taste is yummy hot chocolate  my family burned through the first box and i just ordered two more  if you dont like this i feel sorry for you better to have numb taste buds i guess  enjoy
3482,5,when i got my keurig brewer last month i bought two different types of hot chocolate  the grove square hot chocolate is far superior  i have so far brewed it on oz and oz with good flavor at both sizes  the flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup the other brand does maybe i got a bad batch  overall i will happily buy this one again
3483,5,i got these cocoa cups based on my sisterinlaws recommendation  it has a great flavor and is inexpensive  quite a good combination  ill be ordering more very soon
3484,5,this is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate go for it  you will love it to i would purchase this again
3485,4,ive tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the keurig and this is the only one i keep buying more of when i run out of course its not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk but i find it at least as tasty as any nonkcup cocoa mix ive had it is richer than the same companys milkchocolate cocoa which would however be my  pick of kcup cocoasbr br one star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the kcup which you have to move to your mug if you want maximumstrength cocoa shaking the kcup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some
3486,5,i love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa i drink one at night and each is the same good stuff
3487,5,i am very pleased with this selection  i have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for keurig but this one is awesome  i bought the milk chocolate
3488,2,thought id try these because its a good price but the chocolate flavor is not that good and the sucralose taste is very strong i like the swiss miss hot chocolate ones better even though those have sucralose too you cant really taste it
3489,5,lets face it  isnt going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world  but it does give you a great everyday cocoa in a oz brew great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha and no sugar needed  kids will love it very happy with this purchase  will keep this in my pantry always
3490,5,i have searched for hot chocolate for my keurig but couldnt find any that were economical to purchase i found this at a decent price and was i glad  my husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood try it  youll like it
3491,5,my brother owns a keurig one cup coffee maker which is an amazing device i however dont drink coffee when i came across these hot cocoa kcups i took a chance theyre incredibly good and it gives me a chance to share a hot drink with the coffee crowd without having to boil water or milk this pack is priced well against the coffee kcups as well
3492,1,i have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink it has such a bad aftertaste that i checked the box to see if i ordered sugarfree by mistake i will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this dont buy this brand its downright awful
3493,2,we bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then cafe escapes dark chocolate  it was also thinner in consistency wont buy again
3494,4,i ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free its not the first ingredient is sugar its too much of a pain to return so ill keep it and drink it because its a pretty good kcup hot chocolate i will think twice about ordering it again though id really like to get what i ordered
3495,2,we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa  they are less expensive but you get what you pay for  this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste  i do not recommend ita hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkqtgrove square hot cocoa cups darksingle serve cup for keurig kcup brewers counta
3496,1,i love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack however these are gross  horrible after taste my kids dont even like them  now i have  boxes of the stuff that no one will drink  very disapointed
3497,1,i was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my keurig and even happier there was a variety pack  i read the reviews and even there were some negative ones i went with it anywaysbr i tried the milk chocolate  it has such a weird taste to it  but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night  same weird aftertaste  i asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds werent off he commented that it had a hot plasticy aftertaste to it  not even worth drinking  too bad i have  more cups that will go to waste
3498,5,best kcup hot cocoa on the market bar none would not be without it in the house especially with the winter months coming
3499,1,as a hot chocolate lover i was verrrrry disappointed when i tried this product i first had the peppermint disgusting and then tried the dark chocolate a little better the problem is that you can really taste the artifical sweetener i am a diet soda drinker so i dont have a problem with artifical sweetener its just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste i definitely will not buy again i would not recommend these to anyone
3500,2,im an avid hot chocolate drinker and this is just doesnt measure up  it reminds me of the sugar free swiss miss  no matter what size you set your cup on its just missing that cocoa flavor  maybe the dark chocolate would be better  i personally like the cafe escapes milk chocolate betterbr br i bought a  pack and then i was able to find it at my local grocery store so i bought another one  now im stuck with the  pack
3501,4,this is a very mild hot cocoa  perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee  we love it anytime  next time i will try the dark chocolate
3502,1,taste nothing like how cocoa should taste ill never touch this again ill be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck
3503,5,this is very good hot chocolate creamy and tasty  all of the flavors are good my favorite is the peppermint  i wish the peppermint was available on its own not in the variety pack  my son and i also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows for an extra shot of peppermint taste  in my opinion better than the swiss miss kcups
3504,4,the hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it but as far as i could tell wasnt strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients if you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little but it doesnt take away from the taste of the cocoa so as far as im concerned it wasnt an issue i would say this is on par with the type of cocoa youd get in a coffee machine which is fine because i dont hate coffee machine cocoa i have only tried the peppermint so far and it tasted like peppermint what can i say thats what its supposed to taste like
3505,5,we enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our keurig machine and used to have cafe escapes as our favorite  when i saw the grove square brand at such a great price i thought id give it a try  we love it  it is now our favorite brand  i will be back for more
3506,5,had never heard of this brand before however the price was right for ordering  turns out the family likes this better than the swiss miss kcups we had been using  will continue to buy will continue to use  dont forget to buy the minimarshmallows at the store
3507,5,my husband said it tastes wonderful just like you would get in a restaurantcreamy and flavorful hightly recommends this product
3508,3,this has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there if anyone knows of one that does not have it please let me know it definitely isnt very strong but i coulod handle it if it didnt have the artificial sweetener aftertaste
3509,5,this hot chocolate is very good and flavorful compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend
3510,3,everyone has their own preferences i know  i actually liked the flavor but my wife tried it and couldnt stand how sweet it was  to each hisher own i guess  but now that ive had a second cup i tend to agree  very sweet
3511,3,i bought this becaue they were  for the  pack  i could try them for cup  other in the store were almost cup  overall they are okgood but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area
3512,4,this is a great assortment and pricei only give it  stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint so i add extract nice cocoa flavor to all tho reminds me of homemade
3513,5,best one in k cups todate not watery like several of the others i have tried will now join the subscribe and save groupa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkqkgrove square hot cocoa cups variety pack kcups for keurig brewers count pack of a
3514,4,well the product was good and the taste is great the convenience was excellent and the delivery was quick so whats not to love the darn things tend to clog up my machine never ever happens with coffee may one could run hot water after each serving to prevent the clog otherwise an excellent product
3515,1,ingredients sugar glucose syrup solids coca processed with alkali partially hydrogenated vegetable oil may contain coconut soybean sunflower palm andor canola nonfat dry milk modified whey maltodextrin salt natural and artificial flavors cellulose gum sodium caseinate cornstarch lactose dipotassium phosphate sucralose mono and diglycerides silicon dioxide soy lecithin artificial colorbr contains milk and soybr br people please read labels
3516,2,there is a taste of sugar substitute the aftertaste turns me off ive even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste it didnt so im just using swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig
3517,1,if anyone knows of one that does not have it please let me know it definitely isnt very strong but i coulod handle it if it didnt have the artificial sweetener aftertastethis has artificial sweetener sucorse  just like the other hot chocolates out there
3518,1,i enjoyed these kcups when i used them they tasted pretty good however i quickly noticed that my keurig brewer began to have problems after i started using these and other grove square kcups even when i would brew other cups i would get halfbrewed cups of coffee smaller cups and other issues i cleaned the brewer following all the instructions and tips in the manual the issues came up again as soon as i used these kcups what i discovered is that the grove square kcups were gunking up my brewer badly i had to clean out every part of the brewer completely including the brewer basket area the water reservoir and the internal mechanism after completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal i wont order any grove square products again
3519,4,im really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product ive tried a couple of different brands and the grove square was without doubt the best i recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local joe muggs in a local bam store that was over   for the smallest size and really couldnt tell much difference obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many  and  star ratings for the exact same product oh well i like itbr ps   i like this cocoa well enough that i have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost
3520,2,this hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it although even the sugary taste is weak and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose the consistency is watery and bland this is when i made the oz cup as directed by the directions on the boxbr br i do not recommend this product
3521,5,the price was as fantastic as the taste so convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve no major cleanup to deal with either highly recommended
3522,5,the kids like cocoa perfect when you cant make the kids hot choco tastes good too  count not bad
3523,5,grove square hot chocolate is very tasty  i was searching for the swiss miss brand and the search pulled up this one the price was right so i ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at grove squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup koerig setting you wont be disapointed
3524,5,i love a cup of hot choc in the cold winter months we live in penna and it gets quite chilly here the hot coc is a little sweet for my taste but ive gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while
3525,5,my daughter says this is the very best hot chocolate she has ever had and i love it because no more spilled envelope messes
3526,5,i finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that isnt too sweet i made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip i was hooked from now on this will be the only hot cocoa i drink
3527,5,my grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together i get it every other month  i cant ever be without it
3528,2,i thought the grove hot chocolate is to sweet it also has an off taste i would not recommend this to anybody
3529,4,in my trip through the health area of my local food market i stumbled upon enjoy life boom choco boom dark chocolate bar i just cant resist trying things such as this into the cart it went its rather good it says its dairy nut and soy free and ill take their word the question is taste well its a good tasting bar i have a couple others that i would regard higher but this one is quite good its a bit high in calories  per bar but has no cholesterol or sodium not bad ill pick it up againbr br gary peterson
3530,5,ive ordered most of the cheaper teas etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor and value i cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtjzuatakeya airtight drink maker pitcher  jug set of twoa and it works wonderfully those jugs are great even better if you can still find them half price at costcobr br im glad i ordered this when i did the price has more than doubled id still say its a great value this is my go to tea when i want something with a little more flavor than regular black tea i dont sweeten my tea but i think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day the orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others its noticeable without being pungent or artificial it also isnt spiced like many other orange teas
3531,5,arrived nicely packaged and sealed an aromatic lovely tea that i love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends i love this oolong orange with fruity black teas recommended
3532,5,that is right open the bag and just get your nose close and smell it you know this is a quality product instantly some of the tastiest tea i have had and the oolong and orange are a great mix even if you arent a tea drinker at all once you smell this tea you will want to try it i am very glad i bought this product it is a favorite of mine
3533,1,i bought this to include in my daughters party bag  it worked so well with the circus theme that we had  unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale  when i heard this the first time i thought no way cant be but then someone else told me the same thing and then i heard it again from someone else  really disappointing  i am so embarrassed
3534,5,so fun and great price this was one of our party favors at my sons birthday party huge hit i will buy again for the baseball team and group outings the box is just like the good ol days although i remember the prizes were better back then or maybe my expectations were lower since i was 
3535,1,arrives  postage due in a used friendly s box unfriendly dont you think worst service evertotally unfriendly aweful aweful aweful service
3536,3,it wasnt a bad purchase at just  through warehouse deals fulfilled by amazon and shipped for free but took  stars off because it wasnt a freshness issue but cracker jacksâ® just dont taste the same like when i was a kid back in the s
3537,1,ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck togetherbr br checked the expiration date and it wasnt expiredbr br starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad
3538,5,we bought  cases of these expire date was  months out plenty of time to eat we have  boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc i was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews weve ate  boxes and all were fine so far kids loved it and i did as well prizes were not as good as they used to be but they didnt know the difference a few were educational and that never hurts well probably order another couple cases at  cents per snack you cant go wrong
3539,5,bought these to give out as party favors for my sons baseball themed birthday party  they were a huge hit with both the adults and children
3540,3,product was older then i would purchase if i knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase it gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated
3541,1,i dont know the deal is here but they are terrible  i love cracker jacks and not just cause there is a prize especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to getbr br these arrived and the first box i ate seemed very stale checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so i figured maybe it was that box  but im a few boxes in now and they are all the same its like chewing on cardboard  i event went to the local  to get some to compare and those at  were  timex betterbr br since it was so cheap to get them its not worth the hassle to send them back so i think ill just give them out for halloween
3542,1,cracker jacks were horriblestale not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired
3543,5,i threw my son a baseball themed party for his st birthday what would baseball be without popcorn peanuts get crackerjack item was delivered as promised  the packaging was old school which was appreciated by parents granparents the even great grandparents item was fresh  taste great
3544,5,i ordered this product for a themed baby shower they went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks loved that i could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags
3545,3,i purchased cases of these for our company picnic the boxes were cute the idea of it all was a big hit but the gift inside was a bust i would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the writings on paper or whatever they were what is cracker jack without the gift inside i find it to be misleading that they call it original  original had the gift inside
3546,2,becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them they expire quick i cant use these i ordered them to use in my november wedding but they expire in march 
3547,4,if youre looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter whatever reason this is a good choice  its nice and crunchy tastes better than other brands ive tried and doesnt separate as much as others  best ive found so far
3548,5,i love these noodles  they are really great for a midnight snack  its not really something that will fill you up for a dinner  if you do eat it for dinner you will be hungry later  maybe some people wouldnt  but it just doesnt stick to my ribs  i love them though and amazon has a really good price
3549,5,this soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy i really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up nice texture it is very satisfying to me im a single gal who doesnt really cook  am often in a hurry for my next meal and i find that this soup really hits the spot although it does tend to be more of a midafternoon snacklight lunch item for me it will tide you over for a while until your next big meal but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hoursbr br personally i looove this soup that much more because i had to give up the ramen cup o noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks  it seems that often these instant noodle packetsbowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do another plus for me is that its not spicy im kind of a wimp with spicy foods plus i have gerdreflux so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy just tasty br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable in my town they only take s and s which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of oh well cant have it all
3550,4,somehow i feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts i dont know why either also unlike peanuts i can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag
3551,5,i have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic  i highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy but tasty  the mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing
3552,5,a suprisingly delightful snack great to have around while im working long hours in front of the computer
3553,3,i really liked this flavor  as someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar this is the perfect treat for me when i crave chocolate or baked goods  the raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting  however the price was very high for the quantity of product  with less than  brazil nuts in the package i felt a little gipped  in future ill try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts berries and coco powder rather than spend  per package  for that price id like a lot more product
3554,5,a great deal it arrived with no damage the taste to me is the best i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them they just dont taste right to me but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it it tastes so good i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also
3555,5,i prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one  theyre usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips  if you like oldschool jerky then i highly recommend this product  delicious
3556,5,recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym  had seen them a few times at the fatted calf in napa but didnt really pay attention  i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again  huge difference in taste and quality  sent my son who is an aspiring chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well
3557,5,ive probably tried about  varieties of beans from rancho gordo  theyre all excellent  some are better suited for one type dish than another and if you visit their website they will tell you what works best for which dishbr br some are just plain gorgeous to boot  and being heirloom i believe you can also save some back to plant if you have the climate for growing them  unfortunately i dontbr br out of all the ones ive tried we like the borlotti best  they cook up plump and will hold their shape with a creamy interior  theyre fantastic for mexicanstyle beans  frijoles borrachos refried whatever you like  and ive also cooked them with ham hocksgarliconions etc for a delightful bowl of beansbr br this particular assortment doesnt have the borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order  its a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their productsbr br oh yeah sign up for their newsletter too steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans
3558,5,i had no idea what this stuff was when it was served to me at a restaurant recently  and i could not stop eating it finally figured out it was kalamata olive tapanade and i wondered where the heck can i get this stuff im totally spoiled now well i headed for where i always go when i want the best of everything  amazoncom and there it was and now i can have it whenever i want i love tossing a bit with pasta particularly the tomato and basil pasta i also order from amazon its great on salads on humus sandwiches and anything else you can think of once you get the taste in your mind hehe its fantabulousbr a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbhtitmpeloponnese kalamata olive spread ounce pack of a
3559,5,i got this for a gift for my father and he loved them  i will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages
3560,4,i know  the description is clear enough about apples  cranberries but i found these sausages to be a little too sweet  my guests agreed  the same company makes sausages that i like better
3561,1,original description and order said assorted chocolates what i gotweeks  laterwas one pack of all white chocolates the least desirable not worth the bother of returning even with prime might be better just buying at local store same or cheaper price when you can see what you get
3562,1,these look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored you would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor they taste like cheap koolaid and not the yummy jelly belly ones i cant seem to find on amazon
3563,3,these arrived fresh and in a timely manner  however flavorwise our family is in agreement that jelly belly produces a richer plum flavor slightly larger sugar plum in size and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums  the price on the albanese sugar plums is reasonable the flavor is good and its always nice to support a small independent candymaker
3564,5,this coffee is really rich perfect in the morning i ordered it for the office but it was going fast after a day or so i decided it was too goodfine to share so i swapped it out wsome cheap stuff and brought it home more for me
3565,5,this canned organic corn is great sweet and plump and being organic is added bonus inside the can lining looks just like edens bpa free cans but so far i cant find the consumer service number of the company to verify if their can is bpa free at least i dont see the white plastic lining in these cans im just hoping these are bpa free then these are totally awesome
3566,5,found this item quite good it was sweet and slightly crunchy all in all a delightful product it arrived in excellent condition no dents and no dings perhaps the packaging has improved
3567,3,perhaps amazon should start a scratch and dent section and sell items like this corn there all but one can of this great tasting corn was dented severely dont get me wrong i will still buy dented goods but only at a discounted price the damage did not occur in transit either which disturbs me if they know they are selling dented cans fine but start a scratch and dent section
3568,5,very good corn product we will be eating this case of corn way faster than we expected  it was well packed and stores in the pantry nicely
3569,3,the fresh tasting libbys organic corn no additives i cant believe amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap but for taste and value this cant be beat
3570,5,i combine this with libbys organic black beans and libbys organic green beans mixed with bobs red mill organic brown rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time
3571,5,we live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices that said i found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock if they even stockedbr br yes some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me i hope the future delivery is the same or betterbr br it is unknown if the can lining is bpa free i try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out its near impossible to buy canned goods that dont have bpa in the can lining pregnant women should avoid anything with bpa in it and if i had growing children i would also strive to avoid
3572,1,they decided to ship both my order in one huge box of  cans instead of  green beans in one box  corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house  then every single can of green beans was dented and  cans of corn were dented
3573,5,i ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light i live on the west coast and this seller is in ca so i got the snickers in just a couple of days instead of br and their shipping costs were less they shipped via post for under  instead of via upsbr lowest price i have paid for this candy and best quality
3574,5,these tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor i did find them cheaper at the cent store cents a pack i went recently and bought  for  heads up for anyone living in ca
3575,3,this was a very good price for bulk ordering however my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for th graders there was never intent to resell these due to ordering limitations i was unable to order all  packs from here
3576,5,i first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand  i sampled a couple and was hooked  i thought this flavor was the best of all in the tictac line  on my flight i was munching on the pack absentmindedly  i landed with the idea of buying several packs  then came the rude surprise  grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on tictac stands  anywherebr br i finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply  this flavor of tictac is best used as a chaser following a heavyduty breath freshening from tictac power mint the blue color  not only is power mint effective it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes  a followup with a single grapefruit restores my mouth to normalitybr br i rate grapefruit as the best flavor with watermelon and the new strawberry foelds close seconds  in general any flavor tictac is effective breathfreshening but grapefruit is truly addicting  tictac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath
3577,5,delicious and unique flavor great for those who like a little tart taste nice the have a  pack since they are pretty hard to find
3578,5,when i stumbled across pink grapefruit tic tacs i was intrigued enough to order them  i do enjoy grapefruit flavors and i love tic tacs with intense flavors  these did not disappoint  they offer an intense flavor that tastes just like real grapefruitbr br an unusual treat
3579,5,look no futher always fresh nothing is worse than stale candy so save yourself from anguish and purchase here today
3580,5,my daughter and i loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally  then i thought if anyone would have them amazon wouldbr br so glad to find them  it made a nice addition to her christmas stocking
3581,5,we found these pink grapefruit tic tacs while vacationing in massachusettes when we returned to california we couldnt find them i was happy to find them here they taste great
3582,5,this is a keeper flavor  hope tic tac removes pink grapefruit from the limited edition category  citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating oniongarlic
3583,5,i rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta but every once in a while i eat some of this as a treat  almost as good as the pastas that i ate while in italy  just make sure you dont over cook
3584,5,i love the meadow  so i guess this review is more about how much i adore this store than it is about the salt which by the way is fabulous  i got my order way faster than i expected which was nice  i would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks and even better if you can visit their lovely store in portland  this is one of the most romantic stores that exists  opening my box of truffle salt and smelling that fragrant scent was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers salt chocolate and wine  ah it is a taste of heavenbr br the salts great  thanks meadow people
3585,1,the purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good and made my home in plenty of time for christmas  the box was opened the day after new years  the cholocates were discolored and dry  the box had expired two months before i made the order  i made a complaint with amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card  this company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper  they would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller i still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so  then trash can
3586,5,a very soft very delicious keebler brand cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around bag cause its never on sale i picked up my order of  bags through warehouse deals fulfilled by amazon for  a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store  bag and hard to find usually in this variety if the sale is right i highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself
3587,5,it is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is meltinyourmouth good
3588,5,i may be dating myself here a bit but i remember when the first soft batch cookies came out  these were the first and they were bigger and yes even softer than these are now  but at that time they were the only soft prepackaged cookie can you believe that besides archway  they then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason they stopped making them  i can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so im wondering why they stoppedbr br anyway back to today these cookies even though theyre smaller are still quite excellent  they are just so soft and taste better than keeblers other soft and chewy cookies  this package made it about  minutes in this house  thats what happens when youre raising a bunch of titan boysbr br great great stuff highly recommend
3589,4,chewy chips ahoy and keebler soft batch are very similar taste and texture i decided to try this since a had a coupon for  off theyre slightly smaller than chips ahoy but thats about it my cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great great cookies and now i have a stockpile of them 
3590,2,what more can i say barley edible  crunch on sugar  did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didnt sell or maybe bad batch  doesnt make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth  kids probably dont care  hope this helps
3591,5,needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors  buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store  as stated in another review the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box  this seemed a bit odd but there were  sheets of wax paper i guess to prevent dust etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom  not much else to say theyre jelly bellys at about half the cost of the local guy
3592,3,i was shocked to see that the bulk version of these jelly bellys are just in a cardboard box no plastic no nothing doesnt seem overly hygienic since i didnt open the box for a few months the jelly bellys were getting softer and crystallizing unbeknownst to me because we live in a wet climate hmmmjust be aware that the packaging should be upgraded
3593,5,i dont understand why this dog food is not full of reviews checkout  they give this dog food  out of  stars which beats science diet and purina one which i use to use and diamond natural is less expensive
3594,5,we purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane the dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach so this food is perfect for them all three dogs love it even the picky one and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that weve tried i cant begin to tell you how pleased i am about that i did a lot of research to find a quality food that isnt full of filler and wont break the bank i am  pleased with this food more so than any of the other more expensive brands that ive tried
3595,5,i have tried many many many different brands i also did my research on whats the best for my dane and most of it is expensive i found this to be very good quality and a good price among chicken soup and canidaebr my gd loves this he eats  cups a day and he would love to eat more he has a shiny coat no allergies and his sensitive stomach thanks the food i highly recommend this but i am buying it somewhere else a little cheaper and  day shipping 
3596,5,over  of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get  or  stars out of  or  diamond naturals is a great food i have  afghans and ive spent many many hours of research to find this out
3597,4,my giant schnauzer was weaned on this food when we changed to blue buffalo eukanauba  lamb and rice and nutro he developers allergies this is the only food that works
3598,5,its amazing how little popularity that diamond pet foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain  i worked at a pet store for about four years our number one recommendations on foods were natural balance and wellness two exceptional foods that are pretty expensive  but for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog those brands can cripple your budget  so when i would get customers who absolutely loved their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks i recommended diamond  diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like purina and iams but contains only natural healthy ingredients  just remember the less garbage you feed your dog byproducts fillers the less your dog uses the bathroom and they stay fuller longer
3599,5,this is the best dog food i have ever purchased and having been a dog training for over  years ive purchased a lot we first tried this food when our new addition an week old german shepherd joined the family and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food with any purebred dog health can be an issue and you dont want to fill your dog with byproducts and plant fillers from day one this food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers and i dont understand why there isnt more publicity for this product our other dog a year old english bulldog with constant skinallergy issues was switched over when we discovered this brand and she has not had an allergic reaction since we didnt realize how much it had to do with diet her hair used to fall out in spring not just normal shedding but actual balding from hair loss but this has alleviated that problem as well now our shepherd is a year and a half old and hes eating this large breed adult lamb  rice flavor hes not a big eater but he loves this food will definitely keep him and all future pets on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now kudos diamond for making a wonderful natural dog foodbr br side note i would never buy regular diamond brand food if the bag doesnt say natural on it the standards they are kept to are way lower and the quality suffers immensely stick with natural its a couple dollars more at most and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life isnt that what we all want
3600,5,i dont review much but i have been buying this brand for my irish wolfhound for over  years now  he still loves it and its good for him  if you have a large breed dog this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food
3601,5,this food gets an a rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range however its about  more here on amazon than at the local pet store after a  sales tax
3602,5,my  year old great dane was itching a lot with the lamb meal from the big box stores i started buying this for cheaper and he stopped itching his coat is also looking shinier i wish i would have discovered this years ago it saves me trips to the pet store and money also
3603,5,i ordered two of these bags for my three dogs  a mastiff a lab and a terrier mutt  they arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes  the dogs like the food their coats are shiny and the mastiff didnt vomit when beginning this new food  he has problems when switching foods but he started on the diamond naturals with no problems  im going to continue to buy this food for my dogs
3604,5,i have  dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones i can affordbr my oldest  loves the lamb my husky loves the glucosamine and the youngest farts less on this food which makes everyone happybr i always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods i thoroughly recommend it
3605,5,this salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty  it enhances the salad as its not too overpowering  its a salty mildly seasoned packet of goodness its also very addictive probably due to the msg add olive oil and red wine vinegar mmmmmm  i cant believe i found it here bc you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore
3606,5,i have used this product for a few years now my family and i love how it adds flavor to our salads and frozen vegetable dishes problem was i could only get it at a few grocery stores when i would go home to florida to visit then i couldnt find it at those stores anymore i was happy to find it on amazon and ordered the case quantity which will last a long time
3607,5,i loooove this product  i use it a lot on my salads vegetables  and to season meats  delicious 
3608,5,i love goya salad and vegetable seasoning i tried it once and was hooked its the only thing i use on my salads now i love the small packages i can easily take them to a restaurant i also love the fact that it is much lower in calories than regular salad dressingthankfullythe area that i live in carried this product for a short time and i was able to try it unfortunately the area that i live in stopped carrying the product i know this because i searched every store in the town that i live in as well as the surrounding towns eventually i went to amazon and found the product unfortunately at that time they are out of stock i waited six months and finally amazon had the product again i ended up buying the pack of  eight count boxes to make sure that i never ran out of the product again since i had so many i was able to share with friends and family
3609,5,this is a simple salad seasoning just add vinegar and oil one packet of goyabr salad seasoning and you will have the best salad ever  also you can put inbr a potato salad and is marvelous alsobr please give it a try and enjoy it
3610,5,my husband refuses to eat fish but he loves this it only takes  minutes to make and is way better than any other kind of tuna helper ive triedbr br besides the box itself youll needbr br    can of tuna  oz or i use  ozbr    tablespoon of butterbr    cup of milkbr br its a breeze to prepare just dont leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in because of the milk it likes to boil over just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling
3611,1,the box has only pasta and driedup sauce no tunabr br if you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box it says just add tunabr br so the products is making a false claim  shame on you annie
3612,5,mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same omega  content my local grocery store hasnt been able to get tinned mackerel for several months no one can explain why so i ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value im reordering
3613,5,i have ordered mackerel several times on amazon and most pleased with seasons brand than any other seems to me the fish are smaller therefore less mercurybr packed in olive oil is also a bonus they are not as fishy as others that i have tried i eat them to get a healthy serving of omega  my  year old boy has taken a liking for them as well as my  year old daughter we put a small chunk on a cracker and top with a ring of hot banana peppersa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbhdmwmseason fillets of mackerel in olive oil ounce tins pack of a i would recommend this brand tom heflin
3614,5,i ordered these a while back off of amazon the mild flavor and firm texture is great when they are available here they are about s the cost of my local super market they are always good no matter where i buy them i just wish amazon kept them in stock all the time
3615,5,the product was exactly as i expected and the same as previously bought in retail stores
3616,5,at   a can these are expensive for what they are but are well worth it the mackerel are of very high quality are well packed and not overcoooked or smoked also since fish is the only meat i eat i end up having a can almost every day
3617,5,these are better than the usual canned fish filets tastier and not dry  there are no bones or skins  i worried about mackerel but they are much nicer than say kippered herring filets or sardines in oil  its easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry but youd be losing something that is also tasty
3618,4,they taste good and give you a lot for what you pay the meat was of high quality i was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet rather these are about  small fillet in a can much more like sardines are packaged but these are just fillets was a bit disappointing for that and the info could have been more clear
3619,5,ordered  cases on different dates and got them within  days cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock make for a great meal with some veggies or a saladand this type of fish with omega s is good for you
3620,5,these are wonderful  exactly like the originals only in miniature form  delicious and crispy and the wonderful amaretto flavor  rapid shipping from the seller as well
3621,5,this has been a christmas favorite since my late sisterinlaw introduced our family to these cookies over  years ago  she was from italy and loved these cookies as do we
3622,5,this product makes a great gift  not only are the cookies delicious but the tin is attractive and of good quality  highly recommended
3623,5,when i was in rome i got these for my grandfather as a gift he is from italy so i thought he would enjoy something from home although i wasnt sure if these were a little americanized since a lot of the wording on the tin was in english anyway my grandfather loved them my mom thought they were too sweet but he just loved them and now i am glad i could find them online so i can get him more
3624,5,a little more money than your average cookie but very much worth it  you will not find a cookie like this anywhere else
3625,5,we had candied chestnuts that came in a box in france many years ago and have since looked for them in the states  this year i searched the internet and wala there were some products to try  there were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good  these came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in france but they are excellent
3626,5,the best way to get jelly belly a good price and you only get the flavor you want
3627,1,instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans i received a cardboard box with a plastic bag full of jelly beans  they were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag  on the box there was a typed label that saidgreen apple jelly  belly  oz new  there was no ingredient list company logo allergen information or anything else youd expect to find on food packages i certainly wouldnt eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie  i did ask that it be shipped next day so maybe they couldnt take the time to package it in the advertised tub  amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund which was the only positive part of the experience
3628,5,chocolate with coconut  how can you losebr br i love ross chocolates  you can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate  it is creamy and flavorfulbr br i enjoy these and i buy several flavorsall have the same great quality and taste especially because i try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum  i keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times  they keep very nicely
3629,4,very nice product  it is not a mounds bar but it helps satisfy the urge
3630,2,i wait for this cereal to go on sale before i buy it and the sale price is usually  per  ounce box  the regular price is about br br  for  small boxes of less than one ounce each is  cents per boxnearly per ounce the sale price is  cents per ounce  the regular price is  cents per ouncebr br on the other hand this should make two rice krispie treats with one box  starbucks sells rice krispie treats for  as one of their lowest priced snacks
3631,4,de is a very good coffee  i ordered this as my fatherinlaw raved about it and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee  it tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it  very unique and very tasty  i tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a medium coffee and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffeesbr br if you are a coffee fan this is worth a shot pun intendedbr br enjoy
3632,5,i drank this coffee over  years ago when i lived in the netherlands so glad that i can get it through amazon strong full bodied but easy on the tummy
3633,5,if you have a coffee grinder this is the best coffee i would highly recommend it the taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in holland relaxing and watching the passersby
3634,4,this is a very good mediumroast mediumbodied coffee brew it directly after grinding the bean to capture the most flavor
3635,5,this product came as advertizedit was a great buy and i love the taste of the teabr br great deal and happy i purchase from them
3636,2,i bought this for fathers day my father loves dried fruits and nutsbr br it came in a somewhat cute crate box and each compartment was in a plastic bag that means that if you dont eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale as they are now sitting in the open same story for the fruitbr br while all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hardchewybr br i recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece but not if you actually want to eat it
3637,3,i paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister and it turns out it arrived more than a day late thats unacceptable to me
3638,5,i used this flour in my usual pizza recipe i noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away the dough was very elastic and easy to work with the pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual i will only use his flour from now on
3639,5,shipping was prompt and the product was what i fully expected  it helped me be successful with mama agatas lemon cake where us flours failed
3640,5,i dont know why this flour isnt available in grocery stores in the midwest  typical grocer flours have a protein content much too high to give an authentic taste to such foods as pizza crust and homemade pastas  and after years of making homemade pastas and trying to find that perfect recipe that would result in those served in the best italian restaurants in the us and europe im happy to discover the secret was in the  protein content all along  what a fabulous difference this flour makes  freezes well too
3641,5,so this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana  im really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the usa  this flour makes the most silky smooth dough ive ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with and it has a different better for pizza taste than the allpurpose store brand flour  sure it costs a little more its coming from italy but given that you can make about  pizzas per bag  whos counting  get this stuff some dop tomatoes grow some basil and make some mozarella okay i admit havent done this one  yet but given the first couple items there and youre well on your way to the origins of pizza in naples italy is it worth it i say si mangia and taylors market always comes through for my home shipments cheers
3642,5,i ordered this italian flour after reading an article about some of the issues with american wheat it isbr light and everything ive made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious it was shippedbr very quickly
3643,5,if you follow their recipes precisely with careful measurements the freezer jams are excellent  strawberry jam is particularly appealing  ive been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results
3644,5,sweet juicy and yummy i have to try hard not to eat too much at one time so addictive it tastes just like those in asian market actually this one tastes a bit better
3645,5,dried mangoes are my hubbys favorite fruit  he especially loves the philippine brand  some come close but no cigar  we have searched high  low to find a brand comparative to these but there are none  having them delivered on a regular basis is great  with free shipping  no more detective work and disappointment  he does have to be careful however because he seems to eat them too fast  runs out short of the next delivery maybe i will increase my quantity  quality is the best  delivery on a regular basis was a perfect gift for him  i am very happy  satisfied
3646,5,great value and much superior to what you find in stores makes a great snack or after dinner treat but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up will be ordering more soon 
3647,5,by faar the best dried mangoes i have purchased fresh and full of flavor the  pach oz is probably the best value order a lot because it will be done before you know it trust me it is heartbreaking when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs
3648,4,i remember really loving to eat dried mangos when i was younger so i decided to give this brand a try these werent bad per se but they were a little too sweet for my taste i guess its a good thing though since you dont want to eat a lot of them because the calories will build up unless you control your portions ill eat one and itd satisfy my sweet tooth for hours before i want to eat another one therefore i guess its a good thing that its a little too sweet but still i would have liked less sugar
3649,1,this is not a  oz bag  it is only oz each bag  misleading product  thought i was buying oz bags  not very happy  shouldve gone local for  dollars per bag
3650,3,i love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option doesnt ship at correct times i just received two shipments at once even packaged in the same box this week when one of those shipments was supposed to be for april and i was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card
3651,4,tasty slightly different flavors then other brands but good in all other respects good purchase hard to find in us so i am not too picky
3652,5,this sauce is excellent for authentic chinese dishes my wife is from china and we love to use this product to make hot pot and ma po tofu
3653,4,bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur sp for his dog  the dog didnt really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose  not sure but it appears to have a very salty brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses  however it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over along with their master
3654,4,i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates dogs it looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy they are a german shepard pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly
3655,5,i use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than american teas  it just plain is  it is all i buy and now i get it for others too  look no further
3656,5,im a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different brands out there and i find that pg makes the best black tea its nice and strong not like crappy lipton black tea weve been loyal to the pg brand black tea for over a year now  its a little pricier than other brands but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea
3657,5,i find it is difficult to find black tea in the united states that is of decent quality  i love pg tips  it brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced
3658,5,i really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughterinlaw feel the same  ive used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags encouraging
3659,5,love this teaespecially love triangle bags more flavor  the tea is what i remember it to behappybr came right on time in great shapehappily enjoying my pg tipsa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeqjlepg tips black tea pyramid tea bags count boxes pack of a
3660,5,love pg tips tea  its hard to find in the usa but a standard in the uk
3661,2,i have to say that i really wanted to like these muffins but i could not  they have a really bitter after taste  whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product i do not know  the hodgson mill blueberry muffin mix is a far better choice  on a positive note they do raise very nicely but it is unfortunate that i find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left
3662,5,i baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good  then i stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding  i ate one straight out of the frig and it was great  i guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours  i finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without reheating any of them  they were so good that way i couldnt bring myself to try them any other way  br br our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over  years  the choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease  i have created an astore through amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying 
3663,1,i really wanted these to taste good but there is something in there that is very bitter i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable no one would eat them they looked delicious after baking and theyre healthy but thats only if you manage to choke one down i have tried their gingerbread corn muffin mix and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great
3664,5,if people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product  i only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently i used an erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well  i did not even use a blender to mix
3665,3,this item didnt have the pleasant taste that most of hodgson mills products have such as the wild blueberry muffin mix  however i found it greatly improved the flavor  added nutrition if i grated an apple into the mix it increased the much needed moisture  it was certainly a nutritious breakfast
3666,1,this product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent gluten free as well as nongluten free baking products do not let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make this mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested gluten free product it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well as with many gluten free products new to the market you find yourself constantly adding something to try to make it right to these i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix this mix takes too much doctoring to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this but hodgson mill does have other good products try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a wider array of their gluten free offerings as many are very very good
3667,2,these came out smaller than i expected but the taste as not as good as i thought it should be  second time i added a couple of items which helped a little but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix  i thought it would save me time but i like my own muffins better  my husband thought they were okay but not great
3668,5,i couldnt get these to work for muffins so i decided to try the pancakes and wasnt disappointed they come out perfectly raised every time i like to make these without any sugar in the batter the flax makes it very bitter but i like them like that with lots of butter however if you just add some syrup on top it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact give these a try
3669,1,i have never prepared anything so disgusting  the taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard the smell just as bad  i had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell  i bake often so i know its not a kitchen error and im not that picky but i could not stop gagging i would recommend pamelas browniesadd extra dark chocolate and theyre delicious as brownie bite cookies side recipe on the bag  i even make them super healthy and use c applesause instead of oil
3670,2,i bought these at my local grocery store i wish i would have read the review on here first the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin the negative is they are so bitter i could barely finish my half i just recently found out i have celiac disease  so i cant have gluten i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there
3671,4,these muffins will not win any prizes for flavor  i agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to at least what i remember of real muffins with sugar gluten eggs butter and that other good stuff they are quite finebr br i do not eat gluten derivatives of sugar cane eggs soy dairy corn    i could go on but you get the idea  in order to use this mix i had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me  aside from the fact that i dont have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch the best thing about these muffins is the texture  texture is a challenge absent gluten sugar and eggs and i found this to be very much like how i remember muffins  the bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly sobr br overall i am pleased with my purchase
3672,5,i have  children with food allergies so i have to use egg milk and butter substitutions for these muffins and it works well  i add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a brown sugar and pecan mixture before i bake them  all my kids love them  you can top with just brown sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans  i love these muffins as well
3673,4,folks who are comparing this to hodgsons blueberry muffin mix obviously dont require glutenfree products since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins if like me you require gluten free this is a great product this is the first flavorful gf baked good i have stumbled upon very simple and quick to make like all gf products they are pretty dense in the end but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up personally i added a bit more sugar xylitol than the recipe calls for next batch i will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon my only complaint is that you get so little out of the box makes  small muffins
3674,1,i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart given it was a good price i figured id give it a shot before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input suggestions on the mix wow is everyone using the same mix or what reviews from its great to its horriblelike a total  split soooooo before  i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix all on its own ummmmm yeah it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste  and  like another reviewer i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener i dont like things very sweet at all but its def not as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugarsweetener in this mix so youd def need to add sweetening but overall i dont even plan on taking this mix that far im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away id strongly suggest avoiding this mix i hope the company works on this mix it has good elements to it i like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty and i think it could be really tasty
3675,1,if i could i would give it zero stars  i am not a picky eater but this mix did not rise can you say hockey puck was extremely bitter and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added  save your money
3676,5,these muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box but when i changed the recipe a little by substituting almond milk for the  milk and extra virgin olive oil for the butter they were great  next time i am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar  thank you hodgson mill for a wonderful gluten free product
3677,1,i bought this because i have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins  i am not a health nut i just cant eat gluten  with that said this is nasty  it calls for very little sugar i figure for the health nuts so i simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste  even with extra sugar it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth  i would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again  on a positive note the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund
3678,2,i concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste i also bake often and im certain it wasnt me my gluteneating husband didnt like them either they were also densebr if you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix you might be better off using pamelas baking mix which is awesome and adding apples and cinnamon to it the muffin recipe is on the back of the pamela bagbr in conclusion i dont recommend these they were really disappointing
3679,4,my family really liked these muffins  i also made them while on vacation at my sisters house and her family loved them  i just got back from a bible study full of pretty picky eaters and they all said they were good  theyre usually pretty honest about how the glutenfree food i take tastes even telling me once that some storebought cookies i took tasted like cardboardbr br i did notice a very slight bitter aftertaste but it was not too bad  i think next time i make these i may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch  oh and i only added  tbs of sugar and think they were really good as did everyone else who ate them  im sure that if you add even more sugar the slight aftertaste could disappear altogetherbr br i just went to the hodgson mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix so maybe that improved the aftertaste  this mix does not have garbanzo flour  they use sorghum instead now  i did not make these as muffins  i found that one box is perfect for  mini loaves which i prefer to muffins  very good  i will continue to make these when i need something fast and dont have time to make it from scratchbr br oh and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta
3680,5,i recently discovered that i have sensitivities to dairy and wheat so i have been trying gluten free products  i knew about hodgson mill because of their oat bran hot cereal which is really good and soothes my tummy  consequently i ordered hodgson mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix  both have proven delicious  even my husband who is not gluten sensitive loves the pancakes  i made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning and they were really good and very filling  not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews but i have no complaints and i am very picky  i just wish hodgson mill products were more readily available in our local stores  if anyone has tried their glutenfree pasta please post because lundbergs rice pasta left a lot to be desiredbr br thanks
3681,5,woebers hot  spicy mustard is oh so good  ill buy another case when this gone  makes a great gift as well
3682,5,it is great i like it alot great price too i think it is delicious top quality product in my opinion
3683,5,this is a nice mustard for sandwiches potato salad corned beef roast beef or hot dogs  i have yet to find a single woeber product that i do not like  they are all tasty  i am glad to see that their distribution range has grown over the past ten years
3684,5,i started giving these to my daughter when she was  months  she loved them so much her first word was cracker while signing more  they dissolve in her mouth so i dont have to worry about choking  and they are healthy too  i highly recommend it
3685,5,we have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one yearold daughter wont eat anything else  she will always eat these  her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too
3686,5,my little girl will ask for these crackers day and night  bought a pkg of  and have used up  real quick  i will be back for more very soon
3687,5,i love these graham sticks  they dissolve well and are super yummy yes i have eaten quite a few of them  i think they taste better than any other graham cracker ive tried and theyre organic to boot  as far as sugary snacks go they have pretty healthy ingredients i like pretty much everything ive tried from earths best  for those of you interested in how theyre sweetened they contain organic invert syrup organic evaporated can juice and organic honey  they dont have anything scary in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners  just vitamins and natural organic products
3688,5,and they are good for them with whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers
3689,5,my  year old loves these great snack ive tried to find these at my stores and cant seem to get them very often love that they are organic and my one year old loves that elmo is on the box
3690,5,i love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic i also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios i have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs which makes mommy happy
3691,4,i bought these for my  grandbabies because they are earths best and organic they like thembut not as well as the cinnamon ones i tried themthought they tasted kind of like dirt
3692,5,bought these for my grandbabies and they love them i love them because they are organic only the best for my little guys my big guys even snack on them
3693,1,i bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased earths best organic vanilla cookies had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids  needless to say i should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to  boxes through amazon which you are unable to return even unopened boxes since this is a food item  the crackers smelled strange even before tasting them  my  year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few  i wish i could describe the taste but it would be really hard  it may sound strange for an organic food but it was almost like a faint chemical smell  at best i can say that they werent anything like a regular graham cracker flavor even as an organic option they should have a better taste  my  year old did eat some of them without complaint so i am hoping she will tolerate them through  boxes so i feel like i did not waste my money  good price but definitely test one box first to see if you like them
3694,5, month old loves to eat them on the go they seem great for a healthy quick and easy snack
3695,5,my daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else i try to feed my daughter organic stuff and im so glad that earths best makes a variety of snacks that she can have
3696,5,this is a very good snack that i feel great about offering my  month old  she can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste  my  year old loves them as well  i would definitely recommend these to anyone with small or larger kids  
3697,5,these are the only organic grahams i can find for a reasonable price  we love these and amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers
3698,5,these are great crackers  my little guy likes them a lot and best of all they dont contain any soy or dairy
3699,2,i really didnt notice elmo on the package these are for kids more than adults nothing wrong with flavor but priced for kids that scream alot
3700,5,i have a pure breed gsd and had problems for years with upset stomach eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset  it finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her  i even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work  i tried evo and i could not believe the change  she does not get us up at night to go outside  she was having  bowel movements every day and now she has  or sometimes   i have had her on the evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once  it is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better  thank you thank you evo
3701,5,we have a golden retriever and had been feeding him the wellness dog food  he ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else  i read the ingredients on the evo red meat and was really impressed  i gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isnt really a bargain if your dog wont eat it or get any enjoyment out of it  the first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough  i agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up  he is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him although i wish the price were a little more reasonable
3702,5,i have been feeding my gsd the red meat formula for about  months and all i can say is wow before i started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price you feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about  weeks his skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too the only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stoolsbut it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted all in all if you can afford to feed them evo its well worth the investment
3703,5,when i got my dog i did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients there are high quality dog foods like this one out there but you probably wont find them in regular supermarkets while this food may be more expensive than other dog foods it is well worth it innova evo is one of the foods that were not affected by the recall also the ingredients are healthier and dont have high wheatgrain content or nasty additivesbr br my doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems also her poop was really mushy almost diarrhea when i finally switched her to innova evo red meat id wished id done it sooner she doesnt need to eat quite as much and her coat is beautiful no more dandruff problems and her skin is great
3704,5,we have two great danes and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on thembr br evo is the first dog food that both of them enjoys  i dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eatbr br i have also notice that our older dane is more active since he has been eating evo we feed them a mixture of the innova evo red meat and innova evo large bite dry dog food
3705,5,i have a   year old  pound german wirehair pointer  we feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs  he burns so many calories he eats  cups of this food a day with zeal  we use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth and to slow his eating  due to the high quality of this food he can keep up his energy keep his weight up and recover more quickly from scrapesbumps from running the field  our vets exact words were your dog is an example of perfect health  you may think the price on this food is high but it is worth it  you get what you pay for  also consider the canned version of this food  it is a nice way to feedhydrate a dog after a long day hunting  just give them an hour to settle down first  on a side note we feed diamond naturals beef and rice in the off season  we have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other we switch over a period of a few weeks
3706,5,complete proteinbased nutrition  my dogs love thisalthough im not sure the pibble actually tastes it she inhales it so fast  br br regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues  my gastropicky gsd is that a word i think other gsd owners will understand has had this as well  initially i overfed this food thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuffbr you feed much less of this product  it is nutrientdense and not all filler like other foods  if you overfeed you increase the risk of unpleasant side effectsbr br its a bit pricey and i havent broken down the cost per day but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to run the numbers
3707,5,my wife switched our dogs to this food about  months ago and she has virtually gone from vacuuming daily to once a week  the dogs hardly shed at all anymore no more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny  we have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried  its pricey but we are able to feed them  of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight  this food is well worth the price and the dogs love it
3708,5,this was a new food for my dog and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product thank you and i wish there were more coupons available for this item
3709,5,my husband and i are not coffee drinkers but we love hot chocolate we hated the time it took to heat up the waterand the mess the dry mix sometimes makes we saw that the keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea liked that it was almost instant hot water and bought one i ordered another brand of hot chocolate kcup and absolutely hated it it had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately i was worried i wasted my money on a maker i would never use i decided to try another brand and purchased the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa and we absolutely love it it is sweet and chocolately without being too bitterwhich is why i originally steered away from the dark chocolate i fully recommend this product
3710,1,these cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose  i didnt realize until i tried one and ended up with a little bit of a headache which made me check the ingredient list  it isnt noted on the front of the box  they definitely have an artificial taste i would not buy them again
3711,3,im dieting and i use these as a treat to myself when im craving chocolate  i usually brew one of these  one of my coffee kcups either plain or hazelnutbr br for  calories its not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when youre on a caloriebudget
3712,5,even my kids like this they are always asking for hot cocoa its not too sweet and very chocolaty it is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat enjoy
3713,1,this hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa ive ever had i know its not going to taste like the real thing but after just three cups i cant bring myself to finishing the box i think ill just throw them out our kcup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors weve tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa the first try was very watery so i thought the cup size needs to be reduced this results in just a sweeter cup of hot water stick with coffee
3714,2,these have an artificial sweetener aftertaste not pleasant i would not purchase them again this the first kcup hot chocolate ive tried ill keep looking
3715,1,this product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date  i dont know but ill not buy this again
3716,4,good tasting and the pricing is pretty good its always sold out on keurigcom so i come here to make this purchase i love dark chocolate reason for  stars the pricing isnt great but its okay
3717,5,this is a wonderful dark chocolate flavor  much deeper flavor than the milk chocolate  the milk chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor  will be buying this again
3718,5,the hot chocolate kcups dont work like the coffe kcups  the coffee kcups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the kcup it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip  these cafe escape hot cocoa kcups dont have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the kcup as fast as it can so that the last amount of water to come out of the keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup  so stir it before drinking it otherwise all you taste is the sweetener  also these kcups are made for  oz serving size so use the appropriate cup size for your taste
3719,2,these were a little disappointing the hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strangekind of plastic tasting havent been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
3720,1,after trying several of these kcups we threw the rest of the box away  it only ever created flavorless brown water  we then tried the grove square dark chocolate cocoa kcups and were much happier
3721,5,this seems to be the best brand that i have tried  others have been very weak in flavor but not htis one  i would truly recommend this for moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow  grab the marshmellows and enjoy  grammie smith  grandkids
3722,2,sure to be a hit with chalkaholics everywhere from first sip to last this product suggests its european heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern francebr br some seem to be making a case for it only having  calories but the keurig chai latte only has  and that product actually tastes pretty goodbr br i have yet to find a keurigcompatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old swiss miss scooped from a tub or a foil packet and swiss miss isnt that great to begin with although it sure is cheaper than this stuffbr br i wonder if the size of the keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised
3723,3,this product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing watery texture was a disappointment
3724,5,this is a much better hot chocolate than some of the reviews would have you believe  my wife does not drink coffee calls it yuck and i am very particular about my coffee but we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate  i use a medium cup size setting and it seems to be the best one for this brew  this chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling europe however this did save us airfare but this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure  adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the topbr br if you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away please send my way  i will get rid of them for you  thanksbr br i got this product directly from keurig as one of my two free when i registered my new brewer and purchased two  could not beat that price here but at normal prices this is the dealbr br from the package  calories g fat g carbohydrate g fiber  g sugar g protein  ingredients sugar alkalized cocoa powder creamer and all of those ingredients etc
3725,1,this one has a major problem its waaaay too watery even at the recommended settings the chocolate flavor is okay and its not overly sweet although it still isnt great dark chocolate flavor the really issue is that there isnt any creaminess and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more blech ill pass and im throwing the rest of the box out
3726,1,just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search forbr the best dark rich bold coffee caribou mahogany and other brandsbr with rich taste wolfgang is winning so far but really wanted to findbr the best hot cocoas and got these firstnow trying to give them awaybr the are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores actuallybr i think ive found better instant ones i hate to write a bad review butifbr you want to find a delicious cocoa mix in the kcupsget the grove station brandbr here on amazon  they are always sold out which duh i know why now as they are a far betterbr tasting brand but ifbr you put your email on a wait list theyll let you know when they come in andbr you dont have to wait very long  id stock up though as youll find you want a cupbr or two every night and the dark milk and peppermint combined box is the bombi justbr sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hotbr chocolates wereshell be thrilled to get my care package
3727,1,gross i tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes  the flavor is all fake sweetener odd since sucralose is the last ingredient and no dark chocolate  i am bummed because now i have a box of these cups and dont want to drink them
3728,5,these bites are just enough for a snack they are delicious and the price is very reasonable i will definitely purchase from this company again
3729,5,i tried this brand first and i must admit i became spoiled because subsequently i went to whole foods to try and buy a bunch more i had to get navitas and found they were smaller drier and less flavorful so here i am  this brands golden berries are large with a wonderful more succulent texture the only problem is sometimes i get the seeds stuck in my teeth they have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin the flavor is very strong and captivating  like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet i have noticed my insides are thanking me golden berries are naturally very antiinflammatory they have an addicting flavor that i will gladly continue to feed into
3730,5,imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry these are very tart which i love i eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me these are not super sweet either which is refreshing
3731,5,both my boys have autism and are on strict gfcf diets  the foods by ener g are very good  these cookies although rather crumbly are deliciousbr br my youngest son calls them white cookies  i am a very picky eater  but do enjoy eating a white cookie with him  you should try them with some chocolate melted on themoooh divine 
3732,5,these cookies are delicious my grandaughter ate a whole package the first time she tried them she has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible i will be reordering soon because she has gone through the whole box already and has requested more i am so thankful to have found this product
3733,5,slightly crumbly but overall a very good cookie  in my opinion very similar to chips ahoy but more airy less dense
3734,5,like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble but these arrived in very good condition  the vanilla flavoring stands out  very good for light snacking or dessert
3735,5,son is gluten free but not fun and tasty free so these are great i putbr his icecream on these for a cool snack  taste good to him too just plain
3736,4,my husband eats gf and i dont and its so hard to find him goodies and hes always tempted to eat mine now he has some thing im tempted to eat i thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy
3737,4,i am addicted to these cookies  they taste much better than the regular ones  the only draw back is that they should be available in smaller packages  to avoid binge eating
3738,2,my son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies the taste is okay the texture is hard and weird even when microwaved short shelf life if you are buying in bulk not absolutely terrible but worse than average try pamelas chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful or try a baking mix
3739,5,i read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a persons taste could consistently receive five stars  is something suspicious herebr br nope  heres the tenth fivestar rating in a row and im tough  this is the best sauce of its kind or any kind ive ever had and im an old guy whos been around  just the right sweetness just the right hotness  id love to soak a chicken in it as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggetsbr br these big bottles wont last and ill be back for more fer shure  absolutely more than worth worth the little price this stuff should be standard in every home along with plumbingbr br and my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you
3740,5,this stuff is good my mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip the perfect blend between sweet and spicy this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike spicy or asian or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious
3741,5,this goes down in my self proclaimed condiment queen nation as a keeper i saw it in the asian market i go to for  a huge bottle i looked at the ingredients no preservatives or added colors good good said it went with everything also good got it home and wow its amazing garlic hot sweet i am a dippin fool now
3742,5,and i dont mean just for asian sauces  this is easily the best sauce ever  i put it on everything  its gotten out of hand  i go out of my way to see what else i can have it with  my latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce  then i eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean  sounds gross but its so delicious
3743,5,i use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes  it is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat  if you toss chicken wings in it you will have some great bar food in your own home  another idea combine sweet chili sauce heavy mayonnaise granulated garlic finely chopped parsely ginger powder and splash of siracha  this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers sandwiches egrolls potstickers fries fish or even chicken  like i said  it is good by itself but serves as a great base for other things from salad dressing to marinade  buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything
3744,5,i love this sauce sweet but hot too i use it on checken wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan seared scallops shrimp its very versitile and delicious
3745,4,this sauce is good but for my tastes it isnt hot enough  i have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered  this sauce seems to ahve one layer
3746,5,once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor sometimes when i have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken i put some sweet chili sauce on my rice wow that perks up the whole plate other times i cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor im in the mood for when i reheat it ive kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problembr br if you have never tried this the sauce is thicker than heinz ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving
3747,5,the sauce was just fine however i cant resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy in the hope that someone might be able to convince amazon next time the sauce comes in a pack of  but one bottle was broken yep you guessed it amazon sent me a new pack of two and asked me to return the unbroken original its only cost me a little time but how much its going to cost amazon to ship and process that returned bottle your guess is as good as mine is it really beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle
3748,4,a really great sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores it is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods it is also a great sauce to make chili thai sushi roll
3749,5,ive been using this sauce for over  years now its amazing i use it on everything from spring rolls to salads
3750,5,i made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce  it was great  i love the fact that it doesnt have msg in it  it has the right amount of sweetness  it is a little spicy but just the right amount
3751,5,i use this in and on meats fish poultry vegies all purpose dip et al its cheap and very very special i gave big bottles to familyfriends at xmas years ago and they are all  hooked you wont be sorry you brought this sauce into your kitchen
3752,5,heres a tiny consolation easy thai barbecued chicken cut your usual fryer in quarters cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven and then brush it generously with sweet chili sauce and cook it just a few minutes more most authentic with sticky rice but also delicious with brown or red ricebr br in thailand people squat over hibachisized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken sometimes they trot alongside intercity buses as they pull into stations and sell chicken through the windows dont be squeamish this is a treat youll remember the same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane
3753,5,this sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc  it has just enough heat to make everything taste better
3754,5,this is one of my favorite sauces to have handy with this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while the taste of this is perfect not for the faint of heart however
3755,5,my whole family loves this sauce i use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in maui it adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce service on this order was spectacular several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days amazon service was fast easy and reliable i love amazon also there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good it goes spectaculary with coconut milk vegetables chicken or shrimp and pasta we love it
3756,5,i purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of tijuana flats httpwwwtijuanaflatscom  it goes amazing with steak tostadas but in my home cooking it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment
3757,5,i was introduced to this sauce by a good friend of mine from cambodia who runs a thai restaurant and bar  i wondered what sauce was used in their ramikens when they served their delicious crispy spring rolls  their actual sauce was handmade but i was directed to try this brand  since then about  yrs ago my mother friends and i have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings grilled and sauteed chicken pork springegg rolls and even sushi  i keep the large  oz bottle in my fridge yearround and this is the best brand ive used thus far  not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods but is mostly sweet  try it you wont be disappointed o
3758,5,as mentionedgive this a try  instant party food frozen meatballs and this sauce great on chicken you name itanything partysnackhappy hour food that you put sauce on would work with thisbr br however the prices from some of the vendors obscene   for  oz bottles  this stuff is  for the oz bottle at any asian grocery
3759,5,what i like most about this product is its unique taste just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything i havent tried cooking with it but i can imagine it would add a lot to stews soups etc it keeps well  the last bottle i had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when i found it and it still tasted great it belongs along with the a heinz  worcestershire sauce catsup etc as a condiment staple
3760,5,i had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls i made at home it tastes great and i think it the same sauce i get at some thai places cause it tastes the exact same
3761,5,this is delicious  it makes a gourmet cook out of a novice  put it on chicken pork steakit is ca cest bon  i wish i could say it in chinese  we love it we purchase it on amazon prime  saves a trip to the market makes a wonderful hostess gift
3762,5,the best sauce on the market  we use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies
3763,5,we cook a lot of chinese dishes in our household and this sweet chili sauce is a must have  one of our favorites is sesame chicken but we couldnt seem to get the flavor just right that is until we added this yum
3764,5,i love asian flavor wo the extreme heat  i had this sauce w some wings at mellow mushroom in knoxville tn  i immediately asked the bartender if he could find out the brand of the sauce for me because it was perfect  amazing flavor
3765,5,this is the best sweet chili sauce i have found anywhere some say its to sweet but hey its a sweet chili sauce and its supposed to be sweet it has a rich full flavor that everyone in my family likes even my wife who cant stand anything anyone would consider hot just loves this sauce im a pepper head myself if youre like me and like a little more kick try adding some sriracha hot chili sauce to this and you will learn to love it too
3766,5,this is without doubt the finest sweet chilli sic sauce in the world  i use it with hot or cold dishes including chicken venison or roast beasts  it is superb seasoning for a plain rice quinoa bulghour or couscous  sweet hot and authentic  i buy  of the larger bottles at a time refrigerate the open one and save the backup as insurance  could not run my varied menus without this great red elixir
3767,5,there where plenty of times we had to eat outbutthen came mae ploy sweet chili saucenow we can eat in whih the same flavor exciting taste as being at one of the favorite restaurants
3768,5,this sauce is something of a permanent staple on our table just about everything gets a dash or two or three
3769,5,not truly spicy my  year old loves this stuffbr great on chicken even chicken nuggets for spring rolls the crispy ones and even friesbr its sweet and spicy all in one so very good
3770,5,i go to my mothers home one day she cooked fried chicken and rice i taste the chicken it is good that was the day i was introduced to mae ploy sweet chili sauce this sauce is excellent being sweet and mild hot will not burn your mouth or give heart burn i will continue to purchase this product chicken fish and other foods are more tasteful try it because it is good
3771,5,i use this stuff on pretty much everything turkey sandwiches homemade sushi scrambled eggs chicken nuggets and more so perfect not too spicy not too sour not too expensive either love it
3772,5,i first tasted this sauce when i was visiting in alaska  it was served with fish tacos and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy  i couldnt find it locally so i ordered it from amazon  its available for a reasonable price and is wonderful with fish pork and chicken  i havent tried it on beef but not sure if it would be good or not  its also terrific on vegetables  i highly recommend this product
3773,5,sooo good i followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some mae ploy chili sauce on it with some lime juice too made a nice salad with a kick also very good with cilantro and daikon
3774,5,if you have ever wondered what that delicious dipping sauce for the crab wontons are at pei wei or the amazing sauce on changs chicken is this is itbr br i love this stuff  i discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and i quick snapped a picture took it to amazon and found it it is great on pretty much everything as previous users say  i was also in a thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad  try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos lettuce onions and red peppers  drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef
3775,5,this is the bestbr years ago i used it  loved it moved  could not find it again i have purchased many hotsweet sauces over the years trying to find this flavor recently i found it again at world marketnow im addicted everyone has mentioned great ways to use itbr my favoritei use it on my salads along with a little fatfree dressing now i eat tasty salads every day without the cheesebr br sodium is  mg per tablespoonand the amount of added flavor is worth every mg
3776,5,this is a great multiuse sauce  great for using as a baste when grilling  fish chicken shrimp pork etc
3777,5,this sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy  i love it with eggrolls rice just about anything that needs an extra kick  give it a try
3778,5,mae ploy sweet chili sauce is the best i use it instead of duck sauce check it out once you try it youll be hooked
3779,5,kids love the sauce on many things great on rice chicken spicy  sweetbr br highly recommend
3780,5,tried this sauce first at our favorite place to eat out  was very happy to be able to order some for our home cooking  great  spicy hot and sweet
3781,5,i love this stuff  i put it over chicken and even steaks  its very sweet and just a bit spicy  just a little goes a long way
3782,5,i did not purchase this product off of amazon i purchased the  oz bottle at a local store and i must say its one of the most addicting sauces i have ever had im a pretty picky eater and a vegetarian at that so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one this sauce is almost perfect its very sweet and has a strong garlic taste at first it isnt as thick as the red hot brand which i didnt like much at all thick not as flavorful way too chunky this sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not my son loves spicy food just like his mommy another plus is there are only  calories in  tablespoons and that much sauce goes a long way  gram of fiber too the only thing i have a hard time with and this is just a personal issue is the texture of the red chilli they tastes great but they have a very thin clear skin that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces not all just some i get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy still i eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces i have ever tasted i would recommend anyone to try this sauce first and then try others if you are not fully satisfied this sauce is amazing it was about  at the store for  oz but if you like the easiness of ordering online or cant find it near you know that i would pay amazons price for it any day buy this sauce i dont care where or how just buy it youll fall in love
3783,5,mae ploy sweet chili sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table it has just the right blend of sweet and heat mae ploy enhances the taste of all meat and fish foods catsup is almost a condiment of the past salsa and mae ploy are the answers
3784,3,i was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews but its nothing special for my taste its way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough even my kids agree it reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish so if that sounds good to you go for it but if youre more interested in something more spicy hot and even a little sour you might want to keep looking
3785,3,these are very large bottles it is a good dipping sauce with a sweetspicy flavor
3786,1,i was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews i took a chance  well no one in the family likes this stuff it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce more like what it says it is chili sauce  now im stuck with two huge bottles  sometimes reading the label is really all that matters
3787,5,i have been using this curry paste for several years now and it makes a great dish although it doesnt beat eating indian out its the best paste i have used for at home dishes even though this is a hot paste i would consider it mild
3788,5,pataks sauces have many uses but i always make a basic chicken curry  a friend from india taught this recipe to me and now i always have a jar or two on hand  if you want you can get one of the indian picklesrelishes as a garnish  this is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing  typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish and serves  adults  i always make at least a double batch its just as easy and that way i have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat  you can use any rice but basmati is so fragrant that it is what i prefer  some indian groceries have frozen naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinnerbr br ingredientsbr  â½ lbs chicken breast cut into  cubesbr  cup nonfat plain yogurtbr saltbr  tbs pataks curry paste flavorheat depending on your tastebr br  generous tsp cumin seedbr  generous tsp mustard seedbr  small onion dicedbr  cloves garlic dicedbr  medium potatoes diced same size as chicken cubesbr  carrots diced same size as chicken cubesbr   oz can diced tomatoes with juicebr â½ cup frozen peasbr  tbsp cooking oilbr salt to tastebr br  add chicken yogurt curry paste and about â½ tsp salt to a bowl mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetablesbr  heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hotbr  add cumin seeds and mustard seeds stir  they are ready when mustard seeds start to pop  do not let them burnbr  add onion and garlic  saute until soft  stir constantly or else it will burnbr  add carrots and potatoes  saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat  you have to stir very frequently or they will stickburn  i do not let anything caramelizebr  add chickenyogurt mixture  saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through  lower heat to lowbr  add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit and chicken is cooked throughbr  add peas for color  add salt to tastebr  serve over freshly cooked basmati rice  remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard
3789,5,pataks makes the best curry around i frequently use it in my yellow chicken curry dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old
3790,5,i first drank this tea at naniboujou lodge on the north shore of minnesota and bought a small packet up there i was hooked so after i had drunk the first bit i bought i wanted to get more of this tea asap was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here i used to be a coffee drinker but i much prefer tea  specifically ashbys afternoon tea  now and i just gave away a bag of coffee ill never drink i never quite got why british people are so into tea but  whether this is a typical british tea or not i dont know  i now see why theyd build their afternoons around a highquality tea like this one sublime
3791,5,the gevalia breakfast blend is perhaps the best coffee i have ever purchased  it is fullbodied without being bitter  it also is much cheaper to purchase through amazon  with free shipping for prime members  cant beat it
3792,5,ive tried the other gevalia flavors and this is the only one i like french vanilla stinks its like your regular cup of coffee that goes with any flavred creamer
3793,5,have drunk this as my standard brew for years  however tastes change and im beginning to sense that its a little on the light side for my maturing tastes  nothing wrong with it  its better than most restaurant coffees by a wide margin
3794,5,i was surprised to learn that amazon sells gevalia coffee which led me to search amazon for other household items at great prices i wish all shopping could be this easybr br update   how can the price go from  to over  yikes i guess no more gevalia for me if that price is correct
3795,5,stocking stuffer gift for family  love this brand  blend  full bodied not too dark not too weak  just right  this has become a family favorite that everyone looks forward to receiving
3796,5,everything that is stated in the information is exactly what i had recieved  thank you
3797,5,i purchased this coffee for my grandfather an old vet and lifelong coffee drinker he thoroughly enjoyed it and we were able to share many stories over a nice pot of gevalia i would definitely recommend this brand especially this blend to anyone that loves a good brew cheers
3798,5,several gevalia brand coffees have been among my favorites for yearsvelvet noir signature blend traditional roast etc  the breakfast blend is my go to every day grind  its got a perfect blend of bold rich taste terrific aroma and full taste with very low acidity and harshness  just incredible coffee
3799,5,i tried this coffee two years ago and found it much better then other brands of coffee i had had before since then i have been buying gevalia coffee at amazon amazon offers a good price even lower than that on the gevalia online store
3800,5,the breakfast blend has always been one of my personal favorites from gevalia  gives whole new reason to getting up early on saturday  plus the amazon price could not be beat
3801,5,i love geliva coffeeits not bitter like some of the brands and it set well on my stomachi have too say its the best coffee i every had and i tried a lot of expensive brands as well as the lesser expensive this is mid price and i love iti will continue to buy this frm amazon every three months
3802,5,gevalia kaffee is by far the best coffee on the marketbr especially the coastarican peaberry and the peruvian organic
3803,5,gevalia is the best coffee there is  always mellow never bitter id never drink any other brand
3804,1,i went to check out and found out that the freight is  on an  canned not fresh produce  ridiculous
3805,5,i received a box of this for christmas it is really good not overly strong like most black licorice it is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with no high fructose corn syrup like most candybr molassesbr wheat flourbr licorice extractbr natural flavor aniseed oil
3806,5,this is the best licorice ever  or at least the best ive ever had or can conceive of  the only problem is that now that my pack is gone its hard to concentrate on my work as i go through panda withdrawal and cannot think of anything but panda
3807,5,this is real licorice it is soft has great taste and is very healthy love it
3808,5,i have been eating panda licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand  this is all natural which is what makes it taste great from the licorice root  fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful
3809,5,these chews are tasty and chewy the price is excellent for what you get we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family great treat for little kidsbr plus they are good for you with no added junk just licoricebr great buy great taste
3810,5,this is what black licorice should taste like  no artificial offflavor  no nasty artificial black dye to coat your tongue and teeth  wonderfully soft and chewy  i took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted
3811,5,my daughter and i were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the panda licorice we are very happy with panda and will order again soon
3812,5,this is the best licorice in the usa if you have a craving for something sweet this is it and so good for you i love it and the price is very reasonable i will continue to order this product it is always fresh
3813,5,this black licorice has great flavor and texture some are too soft and too sweet for me personal preference im sure but i like this because its slightly firm not hard but not soft and the sweetness is just right love that its only  ingredients molasses wheat flour licorice extract and aniseed oil price is good too compares to tire tread licorice which is my first choice but i cant find it
3814,5,just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that i did beforeexcellent they are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful really fresh i did the subscribe and save and am happy that i did my husband and i really enjoy this brand the boxes are larger than i realized but i still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me the boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box i cant find one bad thing to say no dissapointments at all
3815,5,i myself do not care for licorice but my husband thinks this is the best licorice he has ever had and he loves the stuff  i have also given it to two friends who are licorice lovers and they say it is delicious
3816,5,panda all natural soft licorice is a great snack for family movie timebr we consume it like it was water its the best snack next to popcorn
3817,5,this all natural licorice is very good  i highly recommend it  i bought this as i a read natural licorice is good for an upset stomach
3818,5,this is by far my favorite black licorice  and the list of ingred could not possibly be shorter or better  now if i could learn how to not eat the whole box in one sitting
3819,5,if you deal with diabetes or hypoglycemia please use real licorice products with care  i ate some of this yesterdy it was delicious and had to skip both my dinner insukin shots  i also woke in the night with a reading of too low for comfort  so if you have insulin resistance please be aware that true licorice candies or extract may have an affect on your body  btw i am buying more today to use medically  i just wont eat so much in one day what a lovely way to get out of getting shots 
3820,5,quality and delicious licorice and this is the best priceoz i could find for quality licorice anywhere highly recommended if youre into buying  worth of candy you can subscribe for the lower price and then unsubscribe no problem
3821,5,love it eating it has got to be a ritual taste is well balanced nice and chewy without being overly sticky leave a great lingering aftertastebr br compared to gimbals scottish dogs these taste and feel more traditional and much healthier too given that only four ingredients go into thembr br out in the midwest ann abor to be specific i found these in the candy aisle for around  per resealable bag of g
3822,5,i got the licorice at a cheese shop in new york and by the time i got home it was all gone so got on the computer and found and bought some thats how much i liked it i have not done the before and do not regret buying it yummmmmm
3823,5,if you liked licorice as a child this is a dream come true  it is soft and the taste rolls off the back of your tonguebut you cant eat just one box
3824,5,i love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies i appreciate that it only has four ingredients
3825,4,the panda black licorice is an excellent product  the raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses  this is fine if you value an all natural product but it is not what i expected  the two flavors that i bought have all been consumed so they tasted good
3826,5,some licorice products leave the teeth with a black film but not so with the panda soft licorice chews  it is a delicious licorice product that improves with age in my opinion  the candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy  if i place it in an airtight container it remains soft but i really love it as the texture changes  the flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice  i was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal  therefore if you want your licorice to remain fresh id recommend placing it in an airtight container  ive also purchased the raspberry flavor but havent tried that yet  i have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as licorice but enjoy the confection also
3827,5,ive always liked licorice candy and the best licorice ive ever had was obtained at ikea it was from sweden yum in any case ive mentioned this around and then a box of panda soft licorice appeared in my christmas stockingbr br the panda licorice is good real good excellent flavor nice and chewy good aftertaste id rank it with the best ive had its imported from finland and is made from all natural ingredients in my opinion it doesnt quite make it up to the licorice i obtain at ikea but its closebr br gary peterson
3828,5,this is by far my favorite licoriceto the point i have a case delivered on a regular monthly basisan option offered by amazona very convenient service
3829,5,this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and i have never tasted better licorice in my life  this product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great  i will purchase another case now
3830,5,nothing but good feedback from everyone a very good classic tasting licorice product we buy it on subscription and save shipping and a little money
3831,5,i first saw this product panda licorice at the memphis tn zoo at the panda exhibit  i thought it was just a promotion for the zoo i bought some it was the really good oldfashion black licorice i used to get when i was a kid not the chalky no taste stuff most is today while at the norway part of epcot at disney fl this year i found the same thing then i realized it is a company brand name made in finland not a zoo promotion i bought some more it cost  per  oz box when i got home i checked several websites and amazon was the cheapest pack of  boxes total cost shipped to methere was a free shipping deal came to  per  oz box it is totally delicious when this is gone i will surly order more
3832,5,i love these licorice  get licorice flavornot just sugar with some flavor  very satisfying
3833,5,i sent the panda licorice to my brotherinlaw who really knows his licorice  he usually buys it by mail specially from one company  his comment was delicious
3834,5,this licorice is great  it taste like the old fashion rope licorice i will continue to buy it
3835,5,i have been enjoying this product for some time  i buy it at wegmans grocery store i believe the cost is under  a box  if you like black licorice you will love this product
3836,5,panda licorice is great it is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the red vines or twizzler brands  i highly recommend a standing order approximately every  months which reduces the overall price per boxbr   amazon is a very reliable and communicative mail order company aloha
3837,5,for those of you who likelove black licorice i seriously recommend this product  i eat it because i love black licorice and only recently found that what i have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well  these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation  it comes in other flavors too but the medicinal effects only come the black
3838,5,i am a fan of black licorice  panda black licorice is simply the best black licorice that i have ever eaten  well done panda
3839,3,panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best it does not have enough chew and i find it a bit drybr br  i much prefer rjs with its big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying just right chew without being gummy
3840,4,not the best ive ever had but good the best ive had was expensive and from an english company i cant remember the name but this is better than the movie kind theyre not quite as moist and rich as the best ones ive tried
3841,3,ive found a new licoricethis one is okbut i really dont need the extra sodium in my body
3842,5,wimpy coffee drinkers beware this is not the bean for youbr if you like strong bold flavor you have found it in larrys  what a great coffeebr starbucks move over larry is in first place
3843,5,im not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic sweet and long lasting my whole family is addicted to this great treat
3844,4,the first can that i got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way an old reused box with not enough padding  when i complained the company was quick to respond  with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail  i was impressed with their responsiveness  the merula oil itself was excellent  a great treat
3845,5,my review is of the strawberrymelon flavor only i did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as i puchased mine individuallybr br i dont usually drink these types of beverages nor do i drink much soda i generally dislike overly sweet artificial ingredient laden stuff quite by chance i tried a strawberry melon fuze slenderize beverage and really liked itbr br what i liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar although it does have sucralose as a sweetener rather than aspartame it was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced i could clearly distinguish both flavors  fuze was really tasty no strong aftertaste and no sugar heaviness in the mouth it was honestly the first time ive had this type of beverage other than a snapple tea beverage that i would purchase againbr br im a little skeptical of the benefits of the micronutrients that are added to this beverage lcarnitine super citrimax and chromium perhaps its a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial nonetheless i found this beverage to be refreshing tasty and something i would buy againbr br it is a little bit pricey though compared to a pack of store brand diet soda which in my neck of the woods ia around  or a little over ounce fuze beverage is priced  for  ounce bottles or a little over ounce that makes it more than  times as expensive as the store brand diet sodasbr br in spite of the price i would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitutebr br  stars
3846,5,i dont drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks  i try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks  by chance i tried one of the slenderize drinks and was amazed  the drink is truly lightly sweet using natural fruit juices acesulfamepotassium and sucralose as sweeteners  would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a soft drink replacement that still isnt as sweet as a typical diet drink
3847,5,i have been looking for a nice strong rose tea and this is the one  ive tried a number of brands but they werent rosy enough for me  this is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor  no bitterness  nice and smooth  i highly recommend this tea
3848,5,the aroma is amazing like a walk in my rose garden minus the beesbut add a little honey in the tea and there you are beautiful taste is smooth full delicious
3849,5,i visited a wineryvineyard in tuscany where they sold leonardi balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines  the flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth i was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some specialty store balsamic vinegars  its like comparing skim milk yuk to cream  which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes
3850,5,there are two types of larger suckers sold on amazon i got the tropical ones this time just as good as the regular kind these ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts well worth the money
3851,5,these mega lollies are the best i eat  a day so they go quickly im not going to tell you how many ive bought since jan  this year they are great i love them
3852,5,i am addicted to this candy will try not to order another batch for awhile this is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm
3853,3,the melitta java pods have a slightly smaller circumference than the senseo pods and are thicker if you are using a senseo coffee machine you probably should moisten the java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid otherwise you risk breaking the latching mechanism the resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the senseo decaf pods the melitta java pods are not really designed for the senseo machine and several other brands such as halo fratello and millstone work better in the senseo machine
3854,2,although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod  the cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery
3855,4,the parisian cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the senseo machine  the box advertises universal fit but it is not
3856,5,coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic fits perfectly in out juan valdez pod maker that was purchased at target several years ago so hard to find these so was glad to find them on amazon
3857,4,smooth coffee but a bit to big for senseo interestingly all the other melitta one pod flavors fit just fine in senseo my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze
3858,1,my husband didnt care for this coffee at all  he complained it lacked flavor and aroma
3859,5,we love melitta coffee pods  makes a perfect cup of coffee every time the coffee is always delicious even the decaf blend  if you have a coffee pod machine try all of their blendstheyre great
3860,5,i love coffee and at night really miss out if i dont have the decaff
3861,5,this decaf pod has wonderful flavor  it is much better than their previous decaf skip the buzz  im glad they upgraded their product
3862,4,i had bought a black and decker onecup coffee maker that used these pods  it didnt work properly but i have managed to use the pods with my old standby coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience  someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging  i have not encountered that problem  overall i am pleased with this purchase
3863,3,some issues with the product  some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out either before use or after use into your coffee it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed  would rather they be packaged like the senseo pods the pods dont really fit my senseo coffee maker  too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when i brew a cup  on the plus side  price
3864,3,melitta pods are full flavored however they do not fit my senseo coffee machine  one pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large  sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets
3865,5,my mom has the hamilton beach single cup coffee maker and was using senseo pods in it they were too strong  bitter for her and i was searching for something else  found these and wolfgang pucks and decided to get both for her  these melitta breakfast blend pods are her favorite she says they have a smooth taste and great flavor granted neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone i dont even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing but she really likes these and is happy to have them
3866,2,to make a decent cup of coffee i have to use two pods at a time i prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it is decafbr what happened to senseo decaf
3867,5,this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby
3868,5,enjoying my java pods very much easy and fast medium strong to wake me up i get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee
3869,1,this coffee a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbmymelitta oneone java podsbreakfast blend coffee count pods pack of a is terrible cheap beans bad roast whatever my lot actually tastes like it is moldy maybe i just got a bad batch i have tried the buzzworthy dark roast melitta pods and they are drinkable even though i prefer medium roast coffees suggest you try one box of these not the  box lot im stuck with also to help you evaluate this response better you should know that i like quality roast kenya aa or sumatra or columbian supremo etc rich flavor type coffees i dont like folgers maxwell house pedestrian type blends but even those are way better than this coffee
3870,5,melitta pods are an inexpensive alternative to kcups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away buyer beware pods vary greatly in the amount of coffee they have in them these allow for a good size cup of coffee
3871,2,i have a melitta oneone machine and have been using juan valdez pods in it  when i ran out i searched for pods for it  only came up with these melittabrand ones i figured incorrectly that the others werent available  purchased these very disappointing  my coffee had been nice strong  tasty but coffee made with these is weak  tasteless  i bought a box package of three different types  am now stuck with them forget these  head to juan valdez same price range unless you like weak coffee
3872,5,ive been using these for a couple of years now i highly recommend these if you only need  cup of coffee
3873,5,this is one of the best decaf coffees i have ever had  i was ordering this product from another website but found that amazons subscribe and safe plan is the most economical  great product
3874,3,a decent clean and simple cup of morning decaf i find prewetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor
3875,3,parisian cafe was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee  i prefer others of the melitta brand
3876,5,though london fruit and herb companys blueberry bliss tea is one of the best teas i have ever had i cannot understand why amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago it is now available through other vendors ie wendell tea company in ma but not at the amazon price  if iss available to them it should be available to amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offeringa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbaglondon fruit  herb company blueberry bliss tea count pack of a
3877,5,i love peppermint but find hard candy just too strong  these melt in your mouth and arent overwhelming and dont leave an aftertaste
3878,1,i can get it at walmart for  each or the gas station for  for  why just why
3879,5,we bought this to use with recipes for our tagine  this is an amazing spice and at an excellent price will buy from again
3880,4,ras el hanout is a versatile moroccan spice blend that can be used for marinading meats with a little oil and vinegar maybe some crushed garlic making stews or just mixed with olive oil and maybe a little crushed garlic for dipping bread  you can find many recipes that use it with a google term like ras el hanout lamb recipe  note that it is sometimes spelled ras el hanoud so you can find even more using thatbr br i first found this at the famous and expensive spice market in istanbul  this blend from angelinas is nearly as good  note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation
3881,5,i love the taste of this ras el hanout in my rice cooker for brown rice and quinoa it makes the meal so much more special large size too that will last awhile
3882,5,this is a nice complex spice blend that makes moroccan food but it can also very easily be used to give body to a quick i dont know what to fix for supper kind of dish  its a great emergency item to have in the cupboard
3883,4,this spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it love it
3884,5,not sure it should be legal we put this and a few other spices i wont share hereon some lamb chops and just fried them they were amazing this spice tastes pretty hot by itself which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out the end result strangely was not hot at all since i like spicy i would usually have been disappointed but this was so good i did not even care seriouslyyou have to try this i ordered two other spices at the same time neither of which will be getting a good review
3885,5,cannot consider ourselves experts on north african or middle eastern cuisine or having enough experience with ras el hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors  but the product was extremely fresh and of exquisite smell and taste so am very pleased with the purchase  will buy more when the time comes
3886,5,i love these noodles  they are really great for a midnight snack  its not really something that will fill you up for a dinner  if you do eat it for dinner you will be hungry later  maybe some people wouldnt  but it just doesnt stick to my ribs  i love them though and amazon has a really good price
3887,5,this soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy i really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up nice texture it is very satisfying to me im a single gal who doesnt really cook  am often in a hurry for my next meal and i find that this soup really hits the spot although it does tend to be more of a midafternoon snacklight lunch item for me it will tide you over for a while until your next big meal but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hoursbr br personally i looove this soup that much more because i had to give up the ramen cup o noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks  it seems that often these instant noodle packetsbowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do another plus for me is that its not spicy im kind of a wimp with spicy foods plus i have gerdreflux so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy just tasty br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable in my town they only take s and s which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of oh well cant have it all
3888,1,im flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on amazon those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny  bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory theres not a molecule of actual truffle in them its a sinful shame thats perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening new york times article called hocuspocus and a beaker of truffles read it and weep br br and if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere you might ask if theyre using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes
3889,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgevgxagoccia black truffle oil from italyabr i highly recommend this product for the price the qaulity is exceptional  it brings on a strong sense of euphoria
3890,4,this black truffle oil from italy is fabulous  its strong and subtle at the same time  its the best deal for exceptional flavor
3891,5,ive never had sunchy malta before i drank a lot of goya when it was available locally tastes similar to goya though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonationbr br i ordered  bottles in order to get free shipping said bottles arrived in  large boxes with each bottle individually packed none broke at the time of purchase this was the best deal going for malta either locally or in stores ive never paid less than fifty cents anywherebr br now though the free shipping is gone unless  sunchy seriously expects me to drop  for shipping per bottle its unlikely ill be buying anymore they should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business modelbr br so  stars for value and the quality of packing with the caveat that i wont be buying any more until sunchy figures out how to sell it
3892,5,after reading that corn and of course pop corn was heavily sprayed with pesticides and agriculture uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it i decided enough was enough it was time to spend a little more and get organic supplier shipped quickly eden foods puts out a great product edenfoodscom certified organic and pops up nicely i use a brown lunch bag top folded down with  tb of corn and  sec in the microwave your microwave time may vary voila perfection add some splendacinnamoncocoa powder mixture and yum yum mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray only  calories for  tb no worries
3893,2,its not real crispy sticks to your teeth and lots of hullsbr br i know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your storebought microwave but its a little too much for me i was really hopeful for this brand but it just didnt work out i tried a couple of different methods popped using different temperatures and also tried different oils it was the same both times with no improvement it doesnt get better after it cools eithernothing worked to improve itbr br it doesnt taste old so i know its not that i seal my popcorn kernels when im not using them as well the flavor is really mild and its definitely a good tasting popcorn it just doesnt turn out the way it should
3894,4,it is very good popcorn  but i used a hotair machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used  although i did pour oil on afterwards  why would i do that with an airpopper you ask  because the airpopper was a gift  i really cant tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from orville r and this but what i have read is this is organic and much better for you  but the price is wellpricey no i dont intend to buy again for that reason but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then i may change my mind
3895,5,this really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking unless you want to use lard  the spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular crisco perhaps a little stiffer  it seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free i highly recommend it
3896,5,we have used this for all types of baking including cakes biscuits and cookies  it works great and is every bit as good as crisco  buy organic
3897,5,this makes the best tortillas  that is about all i use this for so it lasts me awhilebr mine cost about  the price as listed here but it was on sale where i bought it too
3898,5,the  mile chai is just wonderful  the right balance of mellowness and spiciness  ive tried some chais that are a bit too spicy but this one is very well balanced  great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic in as much as one can trust the organic labelbr br compare to peets chai i like the  mile better as imo peets is a little too much on the spicy side although i do still like peets and some may prefer that flavor profile
3899,5,a fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat i bought it for a gift for my brother so i ended up sampling using them myself truly flavorful and hot i use it in my omelets burritos nachos beans
3900,3,if youre used to daves insanity sauce or like me youre used to daves ultimate insanity sauce youre going to be really disappointed  of the  sauces arent spicy at all theyre probably at a spiciness level below tobasco sauce i tried really hard to like them but i just cant get over how watery and weak they are the only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular insanity sauce but as i mentioned above i prefer the ultimate insanity sauce i guess i have plenty of salad dressings
3901,5,i bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it the hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about  minutes and washing my mouth out with water for  other than that one all the others were really good the wooden case doesnt hold the bottles well but the sauces were good i would buy it again
3902,4,this is a cool kit for gifts or a great price on a kit of daves sauce if you use it at home  a good variety  my only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box  i would buy again
3903,3,i am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just ok  nothing special  the insanity hot sauce was fun to try though  i probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive
3904,5,gave these as a gift to my brother we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought id give this a try  the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storagetransport of the saucesbr my brother says that he liked the sauces he would not share with me on chirstmas day so i never got a chance to try them
3905,4,this was a great selection of hot sauces with a good variety of flavor each of the different bottles had a unique taste and each of them had a heat around the same as tabasco sauce oh except for the daves insanity that will have you pleading for the sweet release of deathbr br but the other sauces are very tasty and very usable in everyday cooking recommended
3906,5,for the guy who love to saucethings up heres the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging great idea and perfect gift 
3907,4,my son loved all the sauces  the only sauce that was way too hot was the insanity sauce use a teensy tiny bit when using
3908,5,i have been searching for hot sauces and peppers to compliment my cuisine and i finally found it for those of you that dont like everything as hot as the insanity sauce their are others that are less intense in the grouping for anyone wanting to use these sauces read the instructions on the bottles good job dave
3909,5,excellent customer service quick ship very well packed merchandise my new supplier of all things hot
3910,5,since ive had the insanity sauce before i decided to buy my dad this six pack for his birthdaybr br i tried all sauces but unfortunately i have to say that none of the other  sauces even come close to the heat of the insanity sauce which is the main reason why i buy any hot sauce in the first place to feel the heatbr br for any heat lovers out there if you were looking to buy this six pack i recommend that you buy six insanity sauce bottles instead you will be much happier if you do
3911,5,since the factory burned down that made firecracker brand pickled sausage i have had to get by with the individually packaged version which doesnt remotely taste like the kind i grew up with not to mention they are half the size  these are the best pickled sausages ive had since my last jar of firecrackers a couple years ago  i saw the crappy review and i had to show my support  as a person who grew up on these things i definitely know what im talking about  if you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further
3912,5,i have been searching for an acceptable alternative to the penrose sausages for years and have eaten many mediocre and gross sausages this is the best penrose substitute that i have found
3913,5,everyone who has tried this that i know absolutely loves it there isnt a lot of heat but for me that is fine the flavor is spot on and reminds me of the old fire crackers before they changed the recipe to dry sticks of meat probably made of orphan kids ill definitely will be buying this again only downfall is the stupid shipping costs
3914,5,these eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took  days im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller
3915,5,these are the best beer sausages ive come across in decades they taste just like the old time sausages i used to get in bars when i was younger if you wont take my word for it just ask  of my friends
3916,5,was exactly what i was looking for super fast shipping a bit on the spicy sidebut great tastebr would definately purchase them again
3917,3,ive been looking for a long time for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that i use to enjoy back in the deep south when i was a kid growing up so far ive not been able to find the sausage that rang my bell these arrived quickly and they are tasty and i am glad that i did order these however they are not as good as the ones i use to eat when i was in my teensbr br i gave the product a  star rating because they were tasty but not what i was expecting i know many of you will enjoy these and youll probably rate these as a  star item but i must be honest to provide the best rating possible the  stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste they are not hot as one is led to believe hot makes you sweat these do not
3918,5,these sausages have become difficult to find locally  i was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy  but when there is no other option  so i ordered  jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed  not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is pointless  but the company is great to do business with and they do sell other foods
3919,1,tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened these sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar im used to eating glaziers pickled sausages that snap when you bite them guess i will stick to what i like
3920,2,the product was advertizes as hot sausages the lable on jar says  hot sausage  but they not even warm  the sausages do have agood flavor but just pickled we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for years so i know what im talking about
3921,1,while i gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit
3922,4,this is good stuff and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa one store carries it at times but runs out and at times i send for it through amazoncom the price in the stores can be very expensive and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at amazon adds to the price i wont discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost  my dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so i pay what i pay
3923,5,i was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this andor quality but after having been consuming this for a couple days i really do enjoy it  initially i thought it would be gross but it really wasnt  it is nice with the fruit in it and has a kind of nutty taste great shipping great quality amazing nprice and i def rec
3924,4,zen brews up to an golden amber liquor the aroma is sweet spearmint the blending of this tea is excellentspearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertastebr br remember that this tea does have caffeinehowever it does not say how much on the box a good estimate might be  mgcompared to mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample
3925,5,wow i have to admit these are really yummy i dont know how they did it but they dont have that imitationsugar taste at all theyre small little bars slightly bigger than the normal hersheys miniatures but for only  calories a piece they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office
3926,5,this candy is amazing  great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free  i wish it was for sale locally but am happy i get a chance to purchase online
3927,5,hershey sugar free caramel filled chocolates are very good diabetic friendly chocolate candies these are fairly small but are very tastybr br sweetened with splenda these do not significantly impact my blood sugar levels or cause gastric distressbr br highly recommendedbr br cfh
3928,4,if you cannot eat regular chocolate these are just wonderful  yummy  for diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar plus fewer calories these are very tasty
3929,5,these chocolates are a welcome find  they taste the same as regular chocolate but they dont spike my blood sugar  i treat myself to a couple at a time when i have a sweet tooth  its great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar  and fortunately the maltitol doesnt seem to bother my digestive systembr br theyre a little pricey but i found a great bulk deal at another online source
3930,2,i ordered this prouct along with  others i bought all together to get the free shipping over  what really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and i was charged seperate shipping for each the shipping was such that i could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store i feel i was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by amazon this is the experience i shared with my friends after this purchase i bought books from walmart on line for the first time
3931,5,it was shipped in a very nice package and i have no complain with the seller my plant growing bigger and now i am looking for a bigger pot to transplant its goodif you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need
3932,5,cool i got it last weekend i was suprised about the pot size which was a lot bigger than the regular  pots about the plant there is nothing to complain  within a week there are already new leaves
3933,5,awesome i was looking for this particular plant and homedepotloweswalmart didnt have any i ordered it online a little reluctant  my first even plant purchase online but it is doing great so far i am happy
3934,5,this is excellent green tea  it is just a little spicy and very flavorful  green tea is so good for you you wont even miss your morning coffee  and you are helping children when you buy tea district childrens tribute tea
3935,3,this roasted green tea was only soso to my taste ive found others i like better since i purchased this however it arrived in a box of twelve boxes each with  or so tea bags way too much then i found that we cant return food items so i now have a lot of tea
3936,5,i use this coffee in my espresso maker and all i have to say it wow  the espresso is smooth with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish  its the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me  i hate that strong bitter finish you get with some espresso beans like starbucksand you dont get that with this coffee  i love it and will be ordering more
3937,5,best coffee ever still havent found anything i like better i have never tasted coffee this strong that wasnt bitter at all kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from gevalia if this company started opening stores starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye
3938,5,if i drank more than one commuter cup in the morning id probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two but this espresso made in my stovetop espresso maker is delicious and almost worth getting out of bed for
3939,5,a dark coffee that has no bitterness and is smooth as silk always use quality filtered water and a clean coffee maker if you want a great brew
3940,5,i am now on my last box of three of this gevalia espresso roast and have been impressed it does pack a punch like the other reviewer said one double shot latte of this made in my aeropress at pm keeps me up until a good am in the morning 
3941,5,i was given a pack of this coffee as a gift and it had been sitting around for quite a while over a year when i decided to try it  it was without a doubt one of the best coffees that i have tasted  very smooth and flavorful  i would highly recommend this  after that i ordered a supply from amazon they are vacuum packed i believe much better than store bought coffee  i may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes
3942,5,i love this coffee but i am not sure what has happened to the price lately i used to get this exact product on average for about  dollars and the price has skyrocketed to   i am hesitant to buy this product again for this price
3943,5,this coffee is splendid i cant say much more perfect smoothness not at all bitter just the perfect dark coffee
3944,5,my husband jut loves this coffee  i purchased it for him and i actually loved it  i am a huge starbucks fan but this also does the job for me  i would highly recommend this product
3945,5,i bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life on a recent trip to italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and i was able to find it and order it on amazon i bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews i thought it might be a good idea my husband loves it and actually prefers it to the lavazza  i just bought another  pack we use a stove top bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker highly recommend
3946,5,i have been ordering koeze nuts over  years now  the quality is as good now as they were when i was given my first jar  i gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was these are wallhangers  they really are the best nuts ive ever had  enjoy
3947,5,the nuts were fresh the container was fine for the price because of the quantity that i ordered the freight was marginal
3948,5,koeze colossal cashews are most delicious  cashews i have ever tasted and they are hugebr they arent kidding when they call them jumbo  they  are so very flavorfulbr  order these and you wont be disappointedbr expect youll wish you had ordered a larger size
3949,5,these cashews were what i was hoping for they were large and very fresh they met my expectations i recommend koeze for anyone looking to purchase these especially if they are a gift i was not disappointed
3950,5,i keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids you can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful koolaid drink by just adding a single packet to it just open the bottle pour in the contents of one packet then close and shake each packet contains both the koolaid mix and the amount of sugar thats needed for a single drink perfect size for a typical water bottle we use reusable watter bottles with them so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the koolaidbr br they taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of koolaid just in a single serving size these single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one and end up pouring half of it out these were such a great idea
3951,3,however for the price and additional shipping cost if not receiving that free i would not say this is a such a good value not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freezedried salmon if these were the only treats available to the cats they likely would not last even one week in this small amount in the future id be more apt to open up a cent can of tuna which they are just as fine with
3952,3,the tea was a lot milder in flavor than i was expecting but still pleasant the aroma was light i probably would not buy this again but thats only because i would like a more intense flavor
3953,5,i have fallen in love with this tea i am a british tea fanatic and ashbys has superceded my tastes and expectations smooth not to bitter low tannins awesome taste ill take this over pg tips
3954,5,the packaging is so cute on all of ashbys teas and the tea is exceptional i would recommend this tea to anyone
3955,4,if you have dry skin give this a try a doctor recommended i try this when i complained of itchy skin due to dryness its definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps i used to usebr br as someone already mentioned the packaging design is horrible i used to keep almost empty bottles propped upsidedown in my shower caddy but then decided to use a pump bottle instead which i refillbr br dove br if youre reading this please redesign these bottles so that they are more userfriendly in japan you sell liquid dove soap in pump bottles and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag which are far more ecofriendly and less expensive please consider doing the same for the north american market
3956,5,yeah im a guy just because im a guy doesnt mean i cant want smooth hydrated skin i bought this stuff on a whim i love it the scent is light so as not to overpower and it does make you feel a little cooler as well as hydrated i am no longer dry and itchy after a shower i combined this stuff with a bodyscrub brushwow
3957,2,i love the product  but the bottle design is terrible  in order to get the last  or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down  with the pointy top that is impossible  so you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out  this takes much more time that youll want it to take  redesign the bottle with a flat topplease
3958,5,im a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs until i found this stuff i was using various other body washes with my loofah i always felt like i could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over since i started using this stuff for a few years now i havent looked back this stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah it goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth and it rinses off nice without leaving my skin rough it works well has a nice subtle smell and i wont use anything else
3959,5,i ordered personal items for the first time from amazon and i was very satisfied  the product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly  i will order again going forward  amazon has not disappointed yet  i love the dove body wash  it smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin moisturized well  i have combination skin
3960,5,this was a great bargain worked out cheaper than if i had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was elegible for free shipmentbonus
3961,5,my wife uses this and she has no complains it makes her smell nice and clean and it foams well great moisturizer inside i personally dont care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use i guess that is the moisturizer working very good smell though
3962,5,i just started using this product so i think it is too soon to rate however the order arrived very quickly
3963,5,high quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily it has a very pleasant flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower you only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower so even though the product is expensive you will get a lot of use out of it it seems that the cheaper dollar a bottle kind i sometimes use only lasts a week or  because i have to use more of the product to last throughout a showerbr br i would say the smell lasts for around  hours or so so its almost like perfume my sisterinlaw asked me yesterday you always smell so good what do you wear i wasnt wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before i had done my morning routine and i had to run something over there to her i told her that it must just be the body wash if you have ever used dove shampoo or conditioners it is almost the same smellbr br i am looking forward to trying the cucumbergreen tea kind when i run out of these  bottles i would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life aunt mother girlfriend wife i know many women who would never buy this dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest i intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for thembr br i also use this as bubble bath when i take a nice hot bath excellent product a from me
3964,5,i love this body wash  it leaves my skin feeling very soft  its not greasy either  worth the extra money to buy the real stuff
3965,5,great product and great scheduled deliveries  i get it for my youngest son who lives in a group home not sure what they do with it all but at least hes clean
3966,5,very pleased this stuff smells so good my roommies love to sniff the shower after ive been in there the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery so it gets  stars from me
3967,5,i bought this  pack of dove deep wash and three months later i am still using itbr i dont think i could use any other product
3968,4,i love this body wash  it smells nice works great and feels great on your skin  add in the fact that with the subscribe and save deal it is a great value im sold
3969,5,yes i have bought this before i like the smell and detest the bottle design i do agree with one of the reviewers that the dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in asian countries and sell the refills for them as well i would like it if they have that but i must make due with what i can get at this point in timebr br i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming it takes almost an hour to take a showerbr so im on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routinebr br like i said before i have bought this product in walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky the scent is pleasant not over powering at all lightbr br i dont buy lotion theyre often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i dont like the way i feel after putting on lotion so i buy dove body wash deep moisture i get clean moisturized and dont feel greasy after i get out the showerbr br editbr br i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem buy or find one lying around the house a soap pump for hand soapbr i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product their product is thick ive read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what notbr br if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the dove soap and use in the shower if you can find a  oz bottle maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out theyre oz big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much by the time you get to that second half in the bottle itll be where you want it and you dont come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a dove soap deep moistruizing body wash bottle  xd
3970,4,both my husband and i use this body wash  we both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a moisturizing body wash  it is a little pricey here basically comparable to store prices walmartsupermarket  i order for convenience one less item i have to waste time at a store gettingwith our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from amazon mostly through the subscribe and save program
3971,5,great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet i like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too
3972,5,i use this product every time i shower and it is great i usually get horribly dry skin in the winter but this along with dove lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth the smell is good not overwhelming and you get alot of product the bottle is huge very comparable to department store body washes i have kiehls chanel and shiseido except a lot more affordable
3973,5,needed the soap b weekend ordered on thurs and paid the extra next day shipping even though im prime because no delivery here on sat stuff came s promised on friday and in good package the price of the soap like lots of other stuff nowadays on amazon was higher than local stores so ck prices first amazon aint the lowest usually anymore
3974,1,i will never understand the soaps from mainstream and sometimes otherwise great brands who claim to have a line of sensitive skin products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth as in this case sulfate if youre someone who needs sensitive skin products theres a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls boo refer to their bar soap which is wonderful
3975,1,this product gave me a horrible rash  it contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens  they need to list allergens
3976,5,i like the item or i would not have ordered it however i ordered  and  was confirmed when the order arrived it contained only  four short rather skimpy i usually like to receive what i ordered and for which i paid full price
3977,1,i dont enjoy giving products a bad review but i was so disappointed i had to  ive tried quite a few teas and ive been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so i can get down some pretty harsh teas  i usually dont use any type of sweeteners either because i drink my tea right before bed  ive tried to give this tea a chance  ive tried it with sugar honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk  to me this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too  ive also tried straight chamomile teas before too so i know its not that  i would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea  i havent tried any other twinings products so this review is strictly for this product
3978,5,this tea is what it is supposed to be it is good the packaging was good and the tea is excellent
3979,5,ive been using lourdes chimichurri for years  the stuff is awesome i use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my familys sandwiches were also big fans of the guava and mango spreads highly recommend these products if youre looking for great taste without the preservatives
3980,5,i started using a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbemaaslourdes gourmet chimichurri saucea on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it  now im putting it on my chicken vegetables  pasta  im turning into a real chimichurri addict
3981,5,i absolutely love this product  i use it on chicken beef and as veggie spread its also good in recipes for a little extra kick
3982,5,i was introduced to the blair chips by a friend i mostly ignore potato chips because i really dont like them however these i like the most among all the chips in the blair line they are savory and can be eaten rapidly the hot chips are good because they are so hot i cannot eat them fast i am so happy i cannot get them at local stores because i would eat them all the time
3983,5,these cashews are the best ive ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size
3984,2,something to eat if youre starving  but please give real food to hungry peoplebr br whats in kelloggs corn flakes milled corn sugar malt flavoring high fructose corn syrup salt yes of course it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as bht and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities for nutrition you get basically  carbs from lots of sugar and almost no protein add skim milk or youll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk for added nutrition include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germbr br if you like corn flakes that is your business and you should enjoy them but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than  cents an ounce  per package at this price the inner packages failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish  ounces of this stuff why not use a vacuumsealed container like kretschmers wheat germ to preserve freshness after all its in the same price rangebr br so if you are hungry you are really eating the wrong stuff something to eat if you are starving  but please give real food to other hungry people please
3985,1,it saddens me to say i had to return this item  the items page specifically said the calamares were packed in olive oil  however on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oilan unhealthy oil  that was the bad news  the good news is amazon as usual was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be not returnable  that is why i buy everything online from amazoncom  they are the best
3986,4,the content has been consistantly good the calamares have been tasty the price was also very reasonable
3987,3,watch out for this because i wanted what was pictures however i got different colored flowers  they use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock  the flowers still looked beautiful but i was expecting the white and pink flowers  my wife got orange and yellows one instead
3988,5,at my local costco store i bought pace salsa numerous times the salsa tastes feel rich and i love the jalepenos pace puts in the salsa spicy but not too the point where im sweating and cant enjoy my salsa and chipsbr br the salsa doesnt feel watered down and this is a great go to salsa choice
3989,5,i have a husband who could bathe in pace picante salsa i wish amazon would put it on their subscribe and save program i ordered two bottles and during shipment one of the lids broke and salsa went everywhere amazon immediately gave me my money back im surprised my husband didnt eat the salsa soaked box for dinner
3990,5,the sodium and sugar often corn syrup in tomato sauces is frightening  plus wthem you eat white pasta to boot but wsalsa you eat rice and beans  trust me  dont buy your sauces around your meals get salsa and plan meals around itbr br they arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh i was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock  the vendor did really well
3991,5,these are really great tasting cookies i like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate a nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies
3992,5,these arrived fresh and in very good shape just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door
3993,5,i was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly  it helped that my  year old loves chips ahoy but for convenience alone this was a great purchase since i have free shipping through amazon prime
3994,5,the price is great the serving is just right for a snack and its a cookie buy a bunch and they send it to your house
3995,2,these bags never close well so if you are a compulsive bagcloser forget about it ah the taste you ask dry and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews and why oh why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figureish stickers on the back of their vehicle please just go straight for the original chips ahoy in standard size pig out and forget about the kids for six minutes
3996,4,these cookies are both yummy and well priced i recommend them other cookies i like are mrs fieldspackaged chips ahoy soft baked fig newtons oreos and elf cookies
3997,5,this is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store it is not too firm or soft has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips and makes for a nice snack or dessert we have eaten these for years in my house
3998,4,its a lot of cookies but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store  the packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh  my order from january th has an expiration date of april th  not bad but i would have preferred a later expiration date  other than that no problems  exactly the same chips ahoy you would buy in the store
3999,4,delicious cookies  i actually thought i was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies not the chewy but definitely enjoyed these  the only down side is these seem awfully small
4000,5,exactly what i wantedindividual packages of cookies that i couldnt find at a store  shipping was only cents and came to be in about  daysbr br it was great
4001,5,i really like the crunchy chocolate chip cookies    the soft ones are chemically softened and i think gross  these have good flavor and are great for trips although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged    wait for a rest stop and especially for preschooler snacks
4002,5,i have a bit of a sweet tooth ive tried to ignore it in times past but the reality is that i wantneeda cookie from timetotime as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch these  ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it if i bring one with me i know ill only end up eating one package and not half of a  ounce package single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desertbr br reasonably priced and shipped to your door these are a great purchase
4003,1,i did not know that i was ordering biscuit crumbs that is exactly what i received such a lousy product its amazons fault for shipping out expires products will never order food from amazoncom ever
4004,3,i meant to pick up the normal chewy chips ahoy and was flabbergasted when i returned home to find that they shoved the word oatmeal in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same i decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and doughbr 
4005,2,chips ahoy chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces  my tastebuds say they are too sweet not cooked enough lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes  if you like cookie dough you most likely will enjoy these  ill stick with a crunchy less sweet cookie
4006,5,wow  so far two twostar reviews  one obviously had no idea what they were ordering the other wants crispy cookies  hey im sorry but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before orderingbr br these are chocolateoatmeal cookies  if you dont like that combination dont order this type of cookie  i find the combo quite nice really  the oatmeal sort of calms the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconuttype consistency  now lets also remember that tastes differ so ive given my opinionbr br then these are soft chewy cookies  as advertised  they are not crispy cookies or the blurb would say crispy rather than chewy  i happen to like raw cookie dough however i dont see where these taste like raw cookie dough  both are soft however so is this the confusion  and yes they stick together  soft cookies tend to do that  they arent individually wrapped which would add to the cost  oh yeah chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweetbr br so if you want something hard and crisp i suggest nabisos ginger snaps  if you want a cookie thats soft chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal give these a try  im here to place my second order
4007,1,when i eat junk food id like to enjoy it the guilty pleasure it isbr br these cookies are neither healthy or tasty  stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies
4008,1,tastes pretty crappy its like raw cookiesbr br its not even like a cookie its a squishy thing in a cookie shape
4009,2,i purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies wrong i like chocolate chip and i like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just dont work well together i wish i had read the item listing more carefully even my kids said blech
4010,1,after eating tangs chocolate and doublechocolate cookies all other cookies will taste like expired tepid dogfood to you her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible tim hortons timothys second cup starbucks treats and those horrid packaged cookies at zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a tang cookie her cookies are da bomb a hawt damn
4011,1,overall i was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies they were way to fragile and crumby there is just too many crumbs in my bed how am i supposed to sleep like this
4012,4,sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are and high in omega fats the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinionregular sardines taste a bit too oily fishy and strong to me they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatilei sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling mix with egg oatmeal onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty or add them to a salad although i think these from roland are very good i liked the seasons skinless sardines which are also sold by amazon even better for flavor and texture
4013,4,this is a very tasty product tastes more like tuna however i believe the mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a  cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content i use very little salt and these are somewhat salty i also opened a can of crown prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about  mg the crown prince tasted much less salty than the roland sardines so i think roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients my guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna maybe  mg or higher per  cup serving
4014,3,skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil  not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful
4015,5,i like this product much better than the canned sardines i am able to find at my local grocery stores  i buy rolland and seasons  both sold by amazon  and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture  it is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones  i like both  there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones which along with the omega s is the plus factor for sardines  they work for me  i have eaten them since i  was a kid  ill turn  in july incidentally my cat is crazy about them too
4016,5,sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits and that they arent so stinky after all especially less so after cookingbr br ive used numerous varieties of the roland sardines olive oil sb in olive oil tomato sauce etc  the sb version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendationpreference a great value for the money and practically a steal when you compare per ounce the price with other brands  then consider the discounts when purchasing through amazon and itll be tough to choose another  why  many other brands charge the same price as or more than roland with only a oz tin whereas roland includes more fish in the tin  the quality is consistent and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stirfries salads pasta dishes etc without overpowering the other flavorsbr br oddly enough i was halfmindful when perusing a semilocal dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city  i was looking to make some lowercost and healthier choices in my diet at the time not expecting to find these of course but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud i saw stocked there when i accidentally stumbled across them  at  per tin it was a huge buy so i tried a few  the rest as they say is history as aforementioned
4017,5,just had my st can of these sardines and i am delighted  big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor  made a tuna saladbut used sardines  wonderful  i have to say that i really didnt notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste  love the ones without oil as i dont really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines  i just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism and i read that sardines are good to help restore your thryoid function  ill be ordering more of these
4018,5,roland sb sardines are the best you can buy and believe me  ive tried them all  alsoamazons price is half what i had been paying
4019,5,after the doc said cut the salt and tuna is expensive and pyekky with no sodium and of little health benefit ive been looking for eitzehsbr no salt  tasteless food  ill be a miserybr i took this product added some lemon juice and sprayed on some liquid smoke from an atomizer bottle i comanddered for the occasion mished it up and it tastes great on a matzahbr i can even extend it a little bit by adding some shredded lettuce to the mix and it is my fave breakfastbr low sodium means getting creativebr mustard balsamic vinegar lemon juice worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke have been staples for replacing salt though none comes closebr if you have another salt replacement ingredient to add please put a reply herebr thanks bitayavon
4020,5,water based sardines without salt is awwfuul  not bad of a product herefar superior to the types i normally purchase at stores
4021,5,i love canned sardines and when they put me on a low salt dietbr i figured that was the end of my sardines until i found these they taste fantasticthe price is reasonable and you can at least havebr something that before these sardines was not available to peoplebr on a low salt diet side benefits as they are skinless and bonelessbr thanks to the roand co
4022,5,these are really good the sodium is ok based upon the daily allowance it is a great fast meal when you do not want to cut on the stove and it is really good when added to a salad so far the  low fat sardines has aided me in my weight loss i am going to continue rolands product until i reach my final goal weight they taste good a litte coarse and dry but i normally add the juice to a fork full i love them i learned not to be too critical and enjoy the little things in life
4023,5,ive eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best the extra cost of bonelessskinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste  love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil excellent
4024,4, just water and large pieces of sardines open for all types of combinations of which i find the old whole grain crackers quality cheese a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea the most appealing they do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well solid product even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby sardines are good for a person everyone agrees on that even a sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes the better the bread the better the sandwich so yes  solid stars and i am hungry for the product right now come to think of it
4025,5,the product arrived on time and is delicious thanks very much the price was very fair what else needs to be said
4026,5,i buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and chloresterol down  for about  a can including tax and delivery i feel i am getting my moneys worth  i cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarketbr br sardines are somewhat tasteless  i put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar  if i eat the sardines as a sandwich i used mustard which also has no salt and chloresterol
4027,5,i have had to change my diet and now have better health these are very tasty
4028,5,ive tried many brands of sardines these are my favorite even with low sodium they are full of flavor excellent choice
4029,4,these are the best skinless boneless sardines that ive tried and they are very reasonably priced  they remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines but in a mild rather than bad way and are very firm for waterpacked fish  i especially like these mixed with salsa they work out to can or oz if you choose the longer but free shipping
4030,4,im on a very low sodium intake mgs per day and these are great good taste and low sodium i just put a little mustard on them and yum
4031,4,this is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members made so by a visit to germany hard to find in the states glad to know where to get them
4032,5,yum  i could live off of this stuff  the peach flavor is refreshing and delicious its no longer sold where i live and i really miss it  cant even get it from amazon  its just too good to be discontinued
4033,4,i usually find the citrus sodas too tartacidic for my tastes and i find the black cherry fresca too cloyingly sweet i love the peach its so crisp and refreshing without being acidic and is just the right sweet for me other than ginger ale its my favorite white soda i have been having trouble finding this in the grocery and really hope it hasnt been discontinued
4034,5,i was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a rose wine with the fresca peach and it was delicious and i am not a regualar soda drinker and dont normally drink rose wine make sure to get a rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink koolaid look for offdry or bone dry roses maybe made with a syrah cabernet merlot tempranillo sangiovese zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste but you might like it a sparkling rose would be great too you can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass  or without ice in a martini glass
4035,5,this is an excellent product id does what it says it will bring shine and health to your pets coat and the dogs love it
4036,5,i was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores and this is not just for me i also grow this in trays for my  cats who live indoors deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll all mammals need it and we are now enjoying a strong healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick they crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats their energy levels are better and they are playing more both are perfectly healthy chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation it does a body good if you care about your or other bodies then get this very nice product the shipping is fast and it is packaged well the cans are sealed well with a tightfitting lid yes i am going to continue ordering from this vendor again they have exactly what i am looking for
4037,5,i wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the  stars and ordering them all the time  i bought a bag of these sea salt flavor crisps and a bag of bbq crisps about a month ago in a bid to eat more healthy food  ive always loved bbq chips especially ruffles and lays kc masterpiece chips but theyve got to be killing me slowly right  so i busted open the bbq soy crisps and gagged  how could this be bbq  they tasted like cardboard and i gave them to my friends who will eat anything  i begrudgingly opened the sea salt bag and though more palatable i was still disappointed  i knowi thought you said  stars  it gets betterbr br anyway i had sworn off chips and midday snacking so for two weeks i saw nothing on the counter but genisoy soy crisps  id eat two or three here and there and when i ran out i bought  bags of the sea salt flavor again  what happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drivemy body forgot what those strong bbq flavored chips were like and i started craving soy crisps  i began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars which i had completely missed before apparently because it wasnt a sweet redcrusted overbearing bbq powder  i polished the next bags off in three daysbr br now im ordering  here on amazon  cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food  my advice is thisgive these soy crisps a chance but dont mix them in with your regular doritos and bbq ruffles or youll think theyre awful  stop eating for a month the oily bbq chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips  youll feel better about snacking
4038,5,i found out about these from a coworker they are delicious low calorie and pack some protein eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down i get them by the case now from amazon since it is a better buy and my supermarket doesnt always carry them
4039,5,for people watching weight or nutritionthese chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips  they have plenty of protein as wellbr amazons price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store
4040,5,i love light crispy salty snacks and soy crisps is the best one of those ive found  at only  calories per serving calories for the bag you could literally eat the entire bag which i do on a regular basis and not feel bad about itbr br there are several flavors but deep sea salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soybr br so delish  shipped fast with all crisps in tact  great purchase reordering
4041,4,these are one of my favorite ways to eat grains  plus they are a good source of protein   chips per serving is just about right  i wish they had a little less salt but for the caloriefatfiber content they are pretty healthy  great with soup or salads or just plain  i would definitely recommend these
4042,5,just the same thing i use to buy in the stores but for less same great taste same great package same eveything because it is the exact same thing love is stuff thanks
4043,5,i am a huge fan of genisoy soy crisps deep sea salted flavorbr i love the crunch and texture of this nongreasy snack  the flavor is subtle and very light  no heavy salty taste or greasy lips or fingers after eating  i also like that i can really indulge on these and not feel the regret of eating too many calories  soy crisps are my fav crunchy treat  lt
4044,4,i love this flavor of soy crispsdeep sea salted however they are not available in the smaller individual size like most of the other flavors are my husband prefers the lightly salted ones because they are crispier that the sea salted ones hes right but i do like this softer crunch too it sort of reminds me of popcorn in fact i dont mind the big bag on occasionsfor example if it is a replacement for a big bag of popcorn while watching a movie what a nice healthy treat
4045,4,im a big fan of the carbs fat and protein balance of these crisps the salt isnt overpowering and the taste is ok ive had better soy chips genisoy tortilla chips but these are alright if you dont like the crunch of a chip
4046,5,stores are not carrying this product  thank goodness i can still get thema hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbcmhmucgenisoy soy crisps deep sea salted ounce bags pack of a
4047,5,i love these soy crisps  they are the perfect salty crunch  i have a hard time finding snack foods that dont have wheat corn or some sort of sugar sweetener in them  but these fit the bill  they are very salty tho i like them that way but if youre not used to it and can be kindof surprising
4048,5,these soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking with  grams of protein in each serving they are so much better for you than potato chips or other snack foodsthey have a great flavor just enough salt and leave you feeling satisfied nutritionally and snackwise  my grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking i highly recommend them
4049,5,i recently found out that i am allergic to wheat and milk  as you can imagine this severely limits my snacking options  my local grocery was clearancing all of their organic section so i tried these  they are so good  i love salted  plain rice cakes did before my diet change too  these add an extra punch of flavor and crunch  yum
4050,5,i have a very bad habit of snacking that i cant get rid of so i purchased this to make snacking a little less bad the first time i tried it i was like ugh its gross but soon it started to grow on me its very crispy without being a deep fried potato chip its lightly salted and doesnt have  different fattening unhealthy seasonings and flavorings one entire bag is only like  calories its actually quite good i really like it now and i find myeslf reaching for a bag of gensoy before any type of chip
4051,4,these are the most consistent soy crisps i have had they are light flavorful and always fresh  and usually arrive in very good condition not crumbs they are a bit salty but thats the only point that might be bad  just depends on what youre expecting
4052,5,these soy crisps are very filling and satisfying  if you are looking for something with a great salty crunch these are for youbr br they are high in fiber and protein and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intakebr br i think they are great and recommend them highly
4053,5,i really love these snacks  they are low in calories and fat while being high in protein which is important to me because i am a vegetarian
4054,1,i have been purchasing this product for about  months  the taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number i have gotten  cases where the chips had no flavor at all  have contacted the manufacturer  times  have not received a response from my latest inquiry i dont recommend purchasing
4055,1,i bought these because i had decided i wanted to eat and even snack healthier  these had so many good reviews so i decided to try them  i admit it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first  when i opened them they looked totally unappetizing and then i tasted themit tasted just like a rice cakestyrofoam with salt on it  they also have a very unusual texture  the combination of taste and texture was very disappointing  my teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way  not even the dog would eat them  we tried them with a variety of dips and couldnt come up with a tolerable way to choke them downbr br luckily i have a niece that is newly vegetarian hungry all the time and she took these off my hands  i am still out  for buying the case of these to begin withwhat a waste
4056,1,the product that i received was not the product that was pictured and described on the items page  the worst part of it all was that when i attempted to return the case of soy crisps i was unable to do so  amazon said that this was a nonrefundable item  so i wasted  and i am stuck with a case of soy crisps that i will not eat
4057,5,this has been my favorite soup since childhood  i was pleased to find it available on amazoncom at a very reasonable price  now i plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times
4058,5,zomg these cookies are sooo good i just bought some at the grocery store today after craving raspberry sweets wow was this more than what i was expecting between the chocolate the raspberry and the cookie its heavenly they actually put a nice and consistent amount of filling in these unlike most store bought brands i would definitely recommend them and i will surely buy them again when im having a raspberry and chocolate craving
4059,5,i bake so im rarely impressed by store bought cookies this one thoughdivine  so divine i dont like heavy chocolate or dark chocolate but i like a little chocolate this cookie is the right amount pastry raspberry and chocolate and its light like a madeleine
4060,5,my girlfriend and i bought some of this at stater bros for  or  bucks worth every penny we use this on sandwiches instead of mayo it is the best stuff its not healthy at all in fact it is really bad for you so keep that in mind
4061,5,i am a mustard lover i eat mustard on everything  without a doubt it is the greatest  unfortunately you can only buy in a few stores beaver honey mayonnaise mustardbr maggie
4062,5,i love this beaver brand honey n mustard mayonnaise sauce  it is the best combination that i have ever used makes a great dipping sause for cheeses
4063,4,love this product  very flavorable to most anything  works great on lunch meat ham potato salad more  something similar is sold at honey baked ham locations but this product is much better
4064,4,i bought the blue icicle because i had to quickly record some trumpet lines and i didnt have an interface well actually i did pick up an open box unit that didnt work because they couldnt provide me with the external power supply so i took it back and got the icicle as a quick fix that would get me where i needed to go in a timely mannerbr br hardware imac dual core  ghz processor and  gb or ram os br software garage bandbr mic shure smbr br pros for recording trumpet with an sm it was perfect clear sound low noise lots of signal with the gain a little over half way on the icicle and about  in garage band i got hot horn lines with gain to spare  any hotter and they would have started clipping so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job donebr br cons the gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it  it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly this could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where its set it also feels a bit cheap  its lightweight and feels almost fragile treated with care its fine but i doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and i have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap  i also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didnt plug it directly into the back of the mic  i used it with a mic cablebr br for what i needed it was perfect  simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer and it worked well in a pinch  i just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction  a bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain and i would have rated it a full  stars but as it is i can at best give it 
4065,5,this is all that i needed to make my condensor mic work i have an mlx  and it works great with it without this i was going to need to buy a preamp and something that converted xlr to usb and a phantom power generator this little thing does it all it does exactly what it says it does nothing more and nothing lessbr i am not a professional recorder by any means i just wanted to set up a small studio in my room and be able to have my mic go straight to my laptop without having to buy a small soundboard this might not work for someone who has a fancier setup than mine but for my basic stuff it works amazingbr br the only thing i was surprised about was the size in the picture it looks like its really small but its really like   round and as long as my hand it in no way effects the performance or anything i just thought it was noteworthybr br if this was helpful please take a few seconds to hit the helpful button above i would really appreciate it 
4066,5,i have several of these converters in my home studio  the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics  i had an icicle that initially had a low hum contacted blue and they said that the first  units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed  they sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now  buy this product if you have the need
4067,4,the icicle is truly a great piece of hardware its as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your usb the best thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer it is light weight so i dont know its durability and dont plan on throwing it to find out the icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus but remember with this is a  dollar plug n play tool so it doesnt have any other featuresbr br also i didnt have the noisefeedback issue
4068,5,though this micpreamp has several weaknesses i give this  stars because its just perfect for what i dobr br ive been finding ways to record vocal in convenient way with good quality everyone told me im suppose to get audio interface for good vocal recording but audio interfaces always ended up with frustrationbr br after seeing several reviews of icicle i was going to return this but once i used it i dont think i want to return it anymorebr br this preamp is way beyond my expectationbr br however like i mentioned above it has weaknesses so this might not be a solution for many peoplebr br  it has no headphone jack for direct monitoringbr  no asio driverbr  only one inputbr  does not look strong so always be carefulbr br if you are a person like me who just to need to record vocal conveniently using easy software like cool edit or audacity you wont regret
4069,1,just plug and play with your preferred software  no hassles worked great for about  months then just stopped working  didnt drop it it is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather  feels cheap  it just stopped working  when i buy a product i dont just want it to work great for three months  totally dissapointed
4070,5,i tried this on both mac os x and on vista not on the same computer and it worked perfectly with both although vista was a little confusing nothing more was involved than finding the right audio preferences  no drivers in either case  i recorded a short review of the blue for each setup with each setup which i posted on my devnotes posterous com blog  you can search that out and listen to both of them if you have any doubts about the sound  the whole thing lights up blue when its plugged in so if you love blue this mics for you  i have a behringer condenser mic about the least expensive mic you can find but it sounded great before and it sounds great through the blue icicle
4071,4,ive owned this product for about a year already and it is still working completely fine although there was a few technical issues i had to figure out myself theres no problem with the blue icicle itself though there would be a problem when trying to install this with windows  there was no problem at all using it with windows xp it seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being blue icicle instead it would show up as usb multichannel audio device it just didnt sound the same when i was using it with windows xp it sounded more louder with some feedback in the background what i did to fix this problem was to uninstall the usb multichannel audio device driver from device manager then unplug the icicle and plug it back in when the installing device driver software notification pops up click it and click skip obtaining driver software from windows update it will now be installed as blue icicle and work like how it should be make sure you raise the levels up in sound in control panel if the mic sounds too low for you even with the gain control volume up it shouldnt be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background im not sure if im the only one with this problem but i hope this helps whoever doesbr br when i first got the icicle it sounded amazing and i had a lot of fun with it i still do too i use this with my audiotechnica at i use it almost everyday whether if its for music producing or online gaming with friends and yes this does work for the ps  not sure about the xbox  though i recommend this product for anyone who doesnt have a mixer for their microphone cause mixers are kind of expensive haha
4072,1,owned two of these and when they work they are fine  the power knob has no indicator on it though  my biggest problem and the reason i will never purchase another is this both gave out with in a year  one now sounds like i am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away  do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option
4073,1,great audio until a few months in it just decides to stop working common problem google it and youll see cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world feels like a fast food toybr br i do not recommend this product piece o garbage
4074,2,i will admit the icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an xlr jack to your computer using a usb jack it does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording softwarebr br beyond that the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording levelbr br i tried this with an akg  blue encore  and an akg  all deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain i could barely get an audible record level yelling into the encore  my staple for location voice recording normally i plug the encore directly into a digital audio recorder with an xlr cable no mic preamp no phantom power no eq and i get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input levelbr br this is one very disappointing product if you route your mic through a preamp then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer you can get a decent record level but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid personally i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogetherbr br blue makes some great products but this is not one of their better onesbr br for those that dont know channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box typically a mic preamp and a compressor higher end units add some eq capability as well or have other options
4075,5,great usb audio interface i also own the shure xu and they perform just about the samei wish i would have known that before i spent way more on the xu
4076,1,this product was awesome the first couple months i was convinced i was over any potential defective period well after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work it of course stopped working for me i now cant use it for anything serious anything i record that is profound or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with crickets there must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents establishing a solid connection im just happy its not my  blue microphone dont waste your money on the icicle its productive ability has an expiration
4077,1,cheap a plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside  never worked right no user interface no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power
4078,5,put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit does exactly what it says on the tin converts any xlr mic to usb   including phantom power supplybr br we have an neuman professional condenser mic here at blockhouse tv and i kid you not   it sounds amazing with this piece of kit  have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into audacity andor final cut pro and it sounds the business  no hum noise clicks or pop we use it to voice the childrens animation dvd series jack and holly  both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable setup to use ok  looks arent great  and its plastic  but i dont really give a monkeys about that  all i care about is the signal to noise ratio the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics  the answer is  yes it can  we say buybr br  a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbampzjack and hollys christmas countdown us formata a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgwtmjack and hollys christmas countdown european formatdvd a
4079,4,i already have the bluebird from blue and was using it to record a friends live performance with only a laptop computer at my disposal i was able to connect my xlr to usb directly into garageband the icicle is small portable and so easy to use plus i didnt have to carry a huge a to d converter
4080,1,i was told by the salesman at guitar center that the icicle was easy and very high quality    it is perfectly easy but i have had nothing but problems from mine there is a constant popping in anything i record  i am using an akg cb microphone i have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic  anyone else having this problem havent been in touch with tech support yet but i will say i am not happy with the icicle  
4081,3,icicle is a pretty good preamp for the pricebr br very easy setup and a cool design but definitely was not very rigid its very light and made of plasticbr but the one things that i didnt like was the noise it had a fair amount of buzz along with itbr br a cheap preamp for the price but you get what you pay for
4082,2,i find that even with the gain on maximum the volume is not very loud  i use it with a shure sm mic and my macbook using audacity  one must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly  when i use the shure mics with a mixer the analog way there are no volume problemsbr br it is simple to set up being almost plug and play  you have to choose the input source
4083,5,read a few reviews some good and some bad and i finally decided to take the risk since the icicle was on salebr br works great and is perfect for a homeroom studiobr br  i love everything blue though the icicle is a little light and delicate i treat it as careful as i do my microphonebr br i would highly recommend this product
4084,4,have only had the need to use this a few times but it has always performed well and consistently nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels  doesnt seem to color the tone in any negative way
4085,2,the product was simply not recognized by my windows  home premium computer very disappointed considering on the blue website it says that it is i gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing most likely wont be buying anything else from blue
4086,4,i have little doubt that the blue icicle will get the job done with a shure sm or similar dynamic microphone  but its claim that it will convert any condenser mic even one that normally requires xlr connection and phantom power into a plug n play usb mic should not be taken at face value  i say this because i have an acquaintance with the original audio technica at condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion  in the long run he would have been ahead in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks by purchasing the at usb mic  as it is the blue icicle is probably the best such converter on the market the comparably priced lightsnake cable will not convert condenser mics despite what you may have read  so if necessary give it a tryand more than one  but make sure there are return privileges
4087,4,works fine for my podcasting needs i use it with a sure sm microphone it is made of plastic and does feel cheap but i have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it for desktop use it should be fine works great for my needs wouldnt recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around
4088,5,it does what it says i was only worried that either it wouldnt be compatible with my mic or that my computer wouldnt recognize it but everything turned out great its plug and play my computer running windows  instantly recognized it and i was able to use this right away in less than  minutes from unboxing itbr br it seemed like a joke to me at first because it is so small and lightweight so i thought it wouldnt actually supply phantom power or something like that but it actually does so this is pretty great what i love most about this is that it is extremely portable and easy to set up i definitely recommend this
4089,4,this device does one thing and it does it well i use it to record demos and it provides a crisp clean sound with zero noise i have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle while it feels a little chinsy i hardly think it will snap in half the price is right and the sound is greatbr br for the most part setting the icicle up is incredibly easy i had a few instances where i had to reboot for windows to recognize it again and such but no serious headachesbr br overall this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling musician who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road
4090,5,this thing is great i am running a bluebird into the icicle into logic  and the sound i am getting is tremendous theres little to no noise but it boosts the signal plenty ive had no trouble with not having enough gain i have plenty of sound another thing is that i dont think it feels as light and toylike as a lot of people here have stated just treat it with care and dont drop it like any piece of musical equipment fantastic buy for the money recommended
4091,4,i have used the icicle a few times and it sounds great everything works how its supposed to and it is a very simple but efficient interface the only thing that i can see thats wrong with it is it just feels light and cheap granted its only around  so you cant expect too much from it the plastic just feels rather cheap but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i dont foresee a major problem on that front
4092,5,i was somewhat skeptical about purchasing any xlr to usb adaptor but i have to saythis thing works great the recordings are crisp and clear just as good as recording on my camcorder in pcm now i can record directly to my pc without the need of mini dv tapes and capturing the audio to the computer the unit is a bit cheap feeling weightwise but dont let that fool you one bitbr br its true plug and play too no need for any additional driverssoftwaresimply plug everything together and youre off and running overall its a great product i highly recommend this for anyone who does any amount of voice recording
4093,4, years ago i bought a digidesign  protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording  but i could never get it to work with my os on either computer  i was at an impasse for a long time until i saw this product on blues website  i already had a  condenser mic in the closet i had never gotten to use and didnt want to spend more money on a quality usb mic  i couldnt be happy that this product exists  in its quality or price  i noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem  it does exactly what its suppose to do  act like it doesnt exist  it just serves it purpose to convert the signal well and stays out of the way on everything else  it does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought as many reviews said and that is the only reason i didnt give it  stars  but i dont think that should keep anyone from getting this product
4094,4,ive had this product for  or  months at this point and i use it for podcasting ive used  different mics one was dynamic and the other two condenser all three have worked just fine as if i had plugged them into a mixer or a pa system no problems i have also beaten the crap out of this thing knocked it around way too much and left it on the floor at my desk where i record no problems still runs fine and its not showing any signs of stopping this thing is also super easy plug and record on any software including the free audacity software garage band and sony acid the three ive testedbr one problem that gain knob while very useful is super super touchy i found a volume i liked and then taped it down otherwise itll jack up or down the gain with the slightest jostling doesnt make this a bad product it just means have some tape handy and this is a quick and easy solution especially for podcasters who dont want to be limited to the usb microphones and dont want to shell out big money for a usb compatible mixer
4095,4,using it for recording vocals on home pc using shure c mic it is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure there is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method the  stars instead of  is due to the gain even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough but overall a great product do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well
4096,5,ive heard mixed reviews of this yeah it feels cheap but so what just take care of it like you would anything like that and it sounds perfect i use it to record vocals on logic studio i get others to sing i cannot but they sound amazing ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase well worth the money
4097,4,pros easy to use plug it in set your levels and go works well with condenser mics has v phantom power runs solely off usb no need for a wall wartbr br cons very plastic feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling i wouldnt try to plug it directly into a mic use an xlr cable no headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface i would not recommend it for dynamic mics i tried it with my rode procaster dynamic mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic i also tried it with an old vtech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with itbr br overall it does what its supposed to but it could be a lot better for about  more you can get better interfaces with  mic inputs but this one is nice for situations where running off of usb power is a must
4098,4,simple plugin setup garageband recognizes it right away as long as its opened as first step before plugging in icicle nice clean transparent sound without much coloring with my electrovoice stage mic depending upon your setup you may have to crank up your inputs and headphone volumes to get comfortable levels  blue recommends plugging directly into computer a great little device for the price
4099,5,brought this product for recording a radio program from home along with the behringerbr c microphone provides a cost effective solution
4100,3,the level from this unit was hard to adjust and when all was said and done it was very low
4101,4,i have some nice mics round my place for video and thought i could use them to help my skype chats and for the money it is amazing little usb device
4102,4,i was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here but the warranty blues reputation and amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try and in general im pretty satisfied with it using it with one of my oktava mk microphones i get excellent sound no hum and so far excellent reliability im using it with audacity and a few other programs none of which have any difficulty recognizing it there were some issues setting it up initially and im a bit leery about the plastic construction but for what i paid i think its a good value for those thinking of using it in field recording stick it inside a carrying bag and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the usb connector you shouldnt have any problems
4103,1,i have several different ways of connecting xlr microphones to my computers for use in webinars and i thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect but when i tried to use it with a shure sm mic the volume it produced was about  of what i am used to and was not adequate for my purpose
4104,1,i had this product for literally only a week and had only used it one time when trying to use it again i found that it wasnt sending the sound through when i plug it into my pc it recognizes it and the icicle lights up and i select it as my recording device but then when i actually try to record it makes no sound at all and i have tried moving the gain knob around so its not that this was a complete waste of money unless theres an easy fix that im missing
4105,5,weve only had the blue icicle  week but my daughter loves it and is working with it every daybr br how good is it   my daughter is  and turned down  a year in scholarship money to pepperdines music program as a coluratura soprano  her voice is so perfectly reproduced using a shure  and the icicle that i can not tell when she sings and when she plays it back through the computer an offtheshelf dell using a pair of  jbl computer speakers for soundbr br the icicle is really goodbr br now they can replace the old tv commercial from is it live or is it memorex br to  is it live or is it blue 
4106,3,it does record with ease and decent quality for the price the only problem is it acts as a sound card and you cant record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency this is a deal breaker for me blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you dont have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time
4107,5,lets get this out of the way first yes the case is made of thin flimsy plastic and it doesnt look like it can handle drops to the floorbr br im using it with a behringer ecm mic and real time analyzer rta software on my laptop running windowsxp pro sp to precisely tune notch filters and speaker crossover networks and it works perfectly  audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope with peaks at  degrees which is a good sign  no hissing sounds at all its very quiet with a mic connected high frequencyspectrum wise  for the record i bought a usb to toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptoppc sound cards are usually noisy as hellbr br i think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources eg cheesy soundcards amps receivers or multimedia speakers or even lousy improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit but who knows  what i can safely say is for the cheap price the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrumbr br window functionalityupdatedbr at first it didnt work with windows x ultimate  i kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver  and at the time the icicle website made no mention of windows  compatibility  months later they are saying its compatible with xp vista and windows   after nearly giving up i found my old usb motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar miniusb header to the that of the icicles  i connected the icicle using the motorola cable into my windows  pc and to my surprise it was recognized  i actually got the idea when the icicle began losing its usb connection with the original cable whenever i moved it around a lot  could it be the dinky looking usb cable included with the icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with windows   im really not sure at this point  what i can say is that the blue icicle seems  reliable when used with the old motorola usb cable  perhaps the motorola cable makes better contact or has better shieldingwho knows  im inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original icicle cable just see if its shielded to the usbs electrical ground source  it wouldnt be the first time i find an unshielded usb cable  then again it might be the miniusb header causing the problem
4108,1,this does not work on windows  tried reinstating software and to no surprise it dint work this was a waste of time and money be aware of this issue
4109,5,this icicle performs flawlessly with very good audio quality for my audiotechnica cardiod condensor mic  took me a short while to figure out the little silver button on the side wasnt a button but instead a rotational knob for setting the gain  this device literally plugs into your usb port on a mac you adjust that knob and your done  you then can forget about the device and enjoy flawless audio performance out of your mic  this beats the hell out of the more expensive firewire solutions i had used before
4110,1,i have been using a standard xlr to usb cable with my shure  dynamic mic which works okay except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings  i bought the icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issuesbr br when i received the icicle i couldnt wait to plug it in and take it for a test drive unfortunately right off i got an error  unable to load drivers  this is a plug and play device so there are no drivers to download and i knew something wasnt right after  restarts and uninstalling the usb hubs and ports numerous times as suggested by icicles troubleshooting website it was still a no go  i went to icicles website and logged a ticket explaining the issues in detail and that i was running windows   the next day i received an email instructing me to send the icicle back as it has a defective driver  amazon was great about sending a replacement while the return was on its waybr br so i received the replacement icicle today pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath plugged it in hoping for success no such luck  the same error message came up about the drivers i decided to google my issue  icicle compatibility with windows  and bam it took me to a guitar center review of the icicle that clearly shows in the product specifications that it is not compatible with windows br br amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information  it is nowhere in amazons description and the icicle techs themselves didnt have a clue about it either i found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable  they probably have nontechnical csrs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting thats one way to save a dime but please people  if youre going to give us technical support then say so  if it isnt really technical support then say it is customer servicebr br i am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies  windows  has been out for some time now  there is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the icicle package that says windows  is incompatible it only gives setup info for mac and windows does not show which os  i am sending my icicle back to amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that will work with windows br br if you have a pc that was purchased in  or later save yourself the hassle and dont bother with this product as your os will more than likely be windows 
4111,2,picked one up to use with a laptop running windows  home premium  the computer saw the item but said it needed troubleshooting  nothing worked  after researching online i found that many people had run into this problem  apparently the firmware is not compatible with windows  its supposedly been corrected in newer runs but theres no way to tell if the one youre purchasing is newer or not  i tried contacting blue twice hoping to get a firmware update or check into exchanging it but never got a response from both attempts so i finally just had to return it
4112,5,i have now owned this product for over a year and it is still going strong i mainly use it for voice overs for youtube videos skype calls and recording music it all works greatbr br when i first received it in the mail i simply opened it plugged it in and it worked as simple as that there were no drivers no installation and no updates i just plugged my xlr condenser microphone into the icicle and the icicle to the usb on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a usb micbr br this product was way lighter than i expected and feels rather cheap however that is not really an issue because the product works great and the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appealbr br the knob is also useful as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the micbr br overall i am extremely satisfied with this product as it is plug and play very simple and it just works
4113,1,ill add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the windows  usb audio device error  i figured i had a  chance of it working  it didnt  windows  insists on loading a usb driver that doesnt work  there is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process however that did not work for me  its easier to return this thing than spend my whole weekend jerking around in windows  hardware managerbr br blue probably has a good product here and probably blames windows for this issue  however blue should provide a driver that works  dont rely on windows to do this  that is corporate laziness  spend some resources on programming something that works for windows  make it available on your support website and make it true plug and play  not plug and crossfingers then spend hours messing around in the weeds of windows settingsbr br also agree with other reviews here in the  days i spent with this product its all plastic parts feels cheap and fragile and the gain button is poorly thought outbr br hey blue you had my business then you lost me  im moving on to something else
4114,5,i use this with my audio technica condensor works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain its not bulky which is a nice
4115,5,this people is a must have especially to take xlr over to usb it provides un  interrupted audio flow during recording and provides phantom power great invention 
4116,5,this thing works instantly you plug in your mic and plug the usb into your computer it will light up then you adjust the sound to what is audible it can get pretty loud i was intimidated at first when contemplating the purchase because of the low price but it has done everything i needed it for the other preamp models i was looking at were near br br the only downside to this is that it looks plastic i dont consider it a con because the look doesnt really matter
4117,1,purchased and it came looking new as i had bought it new but it was actually damagedbr customer service with the actual company is awfulas i needed to contact the company itself to return it
4118,5,the icicle is an excellent product works as advertised i think its the easiest way to attach a quality mic directly to your computerbr the icicle is a fine plug  play mic interface
4119,4,going from the  digidesign mbox to this  tube made me feel like i got back at digidesign for screwing all of us who had xp computers that they refused to support after we bought their overpriced gear for recording voice oversbr i could wish that the blue ice converter was made of heavier materials and came with a cs department that one could reach but for  well nough said
4120,1,used it a couple of times over the course of a month and it worked great third time high pitched noise and no mic signal coming through not too surprising given how flimsy this thing feels this is apparently a known issue just look at other star reviews of this product nuff said
4121,4,this product has worked since the first day i have had it tremendous buy for me i needed my mic to go directly into the computer thanks
4122,5,bought this because i didnt want to pay  plus for the alternative found it to be extremely reliable very crisp sound with little to no background noise before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap i disagree though i do find it to be a bit bulky for its function i did drop and break it once but it  was completely my fault after breaking it i contacted customer service and it was replaced very rapidly the companys website was easy to navigate and rather amusing
4123,2,i wanted to like this product as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs but it didnt work well at all  very noisy  lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices  considering the decent reviews by others i may just have a defective unit  either way its going back in the mail today
4124,1,i bought this before i purchased the mxl micmate it is plastic and very cheaply made i felt like it would break very easily and would not be something that would last me a while so then i bought the micmate it is solid metal and is way better sound quality than this i beg you to buy that over the icicle buy the mxl used like new from themintmovieman a great seller and it is a great product a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvzwcmxl micmatec xlr to usb preamp for condenser microphonesa
4125,5,i dont write reviews at all but im just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if youre not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer phantom power supply and preamp for xlr mic recording because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price cop you one
4126,4,patrick gave a spot on explanation of everything just in different uses personally i use it vocally and acoustically and it has worked perfectly in every way however either something is lacking in craftsmanship or  i find my ability to adjust by feel is a little more connected to using numbers instead of blanks i found the quality just like patrick said i too think it feels almost fragile and i also useda mic cable because for me that seemed the most sensible solution because i didnt really need it to move it so i mounted the connection to my desk and now i move it very little aside from the no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it on the gain knob i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk that would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put anyways great product but i guess thats what he said regardlessbr br pros does what it says get it if you need it its at an amazing price compared to the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbppxfagshure xu xlrtousb signal adaptera version this however is fantastic for people saving for a new presonus interface like mebr br cons craftsmanship appears lacking
4127,4,plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustreamtv software interface  this worked well although we needed a little more gain  obtainable by using better software  cubase garage band etc as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc  nicebr it feels a bit flimsy construction wise  but we were not going to take it on the road
4128,5,i use this to record in garageband on my macbook it works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup i love the level knob and the quality construction if you read the instructions and use it correctly this tool is invaluable
4129,4,this product works if you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product so far ive had it a few months with no experience of sound distortion or loss of power its great if you dont want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer ive been told a preamp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my mxl g
4130,5,ive purchased a few of these and they are very reliable ive used them with win and os x the ad quality is acceptable for most needs the limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks
4131,4,i was really worried when i ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat apparently i was worried for nothing i use this paired with a blue yeti pro a seriously beefy microphone running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away its absolutely greatbr br the one downside that i have seen from this piece of kit it will occasionally not register as a usb device granted i only have seen it happen once but you will always want to double check your connections
4132,4,cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting other than that ir records well and does what it needs to
4133,3,never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings for the price paid its very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired overall i can not recommend this product at the current price its sold at  to  dollars then sure still its an ok product
4134,3,it is what is is and it did the job that it was made for lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion
4135,5,i create language teaching materials for a living on both pcs and macs not only do i care about the sound quality of audio recordings for voice but i record a lot of music as well for work i that i do at home i bought the blue microphones icicle to use with high quality condenser mics before buying i read lots of reviews here and some others onlinebr br when the icicle arrived it worked fine right of the bat since then i have recorded hours and hours of audio on it using both pcs and macs not once have i had any problems with the product
4136,5,perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable pricebr easy to open plastic case medium sized durable people have said that the plastic body feels cheapbr and feels easy to break but its not true the icicles plastic body feels durable and wont break ifbr youre not clumsy with it or break it on purpose i only wished that the gain control had numbers or indicationsbr of levels so i can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time sound quality is flawless no buzzing noises or anything picked up reallyjust nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all i hear i hear no difference in it with an icicle or a mixer
4137,5,this product works just as advertised guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic aholes haha i love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend
4138,5,i bought the icicle because i have been doing a lot of hiphop vocals and i was using a samson cu and the thing with that mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alotbr br well i always wanted to buy a expensive mic but didnt want to spend  more on a usb preamp so i see this on here the other day and went to guitar center and after deciding for a while i went with it i also already had a mxl v which is a pretty high end condenser mic although now you can find it for cheap but original rspv and average selling price after it being out was  but i am very happybr br i use reaper to record vocals with a asio driver and it does work with my asio driver someone put in their comment that it doesnt for those of you that arnt familure with asio it is a driverprogram that runs and samples your audio going in you basically use it with anything that is midi or midimic to usb it makes your audio not lag and sound more professional also for the people that said the volume was too low go into sound in windows and turn the mic up a little i keep mine on  also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or afterbr br go ahead and buy one
4139,4,im glad i came across the blue icicle on amazon othere prices where  or more before i went on to buy a mic preamp and source for phantom power i literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price good bargain i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well
4140,4,a great tool for low budget home recording i mic every track to audacity i use a low budget dynamic mic and the icicle gives the right boost for pc recording i keep the gain at  to  percent and do volume control on the pcbr i see some complaints out there about durability keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive not something that you would use onstage or throw into a gig bag another plus is no drivers or setup thats important to me when i get home from work and want to record a tune just plug it in and go
4141,5,i needed the icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings i was doing on my pc i wanted to use my high quality xlr mic for this purpose and found that the icicle provided far better performance than any other usb mic that i currently owned i didnt have any problem with the trim pod on the icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe blue mic has corrected that issuebr br i have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current xlr mic on their pc the product is great and the price is right
4142,4,great price for what you are getting  recording via a usb port rocks the only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability  it feels like a toothpick in your hand  it may be more durable than it feels but im still going to be very careful with it  but for the price this is only a minor gripe  great product i would recommend it to anyone
4143,5,works well  it is slightly lighter than expected but the quality of the sound is excellent
4144,1,i used the icicle for about two hours after taking a break i plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it i did everything i could think of to fix this even hours of searching google nothing in the process of a return  it wouldve been perfect if it just worked
4145,1,it works reasonably well with condenser microphones  with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal  works with windows not with linux  the build is very cheap  anything more than  for this is too much
4146,5,muy buen producto por su tamantildeo uno lo puede llevar a culquier lado junto con su laptop y hacer culquier grabacioacuten en cualquier momento antes de tener este producto tuve muchos problemas con la entrada de audio en mi mac pero con el icicle por fin pude tener una entrada decente para cualquier microacutefono hasta el momento no genera ruidos de ninguacuten tipo y la calidad es impresionante para algo tan simple
4147,3,i bought this device and use a brand new sure  with itbr br the noise and feedback i received with this device was horrible  i might have a bad unitbr br when i called customer service a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit very cool and is why i gave them  stars for nowbr br ill see how that process goes and update my review
4148,4,bought it thinking this would plug into the wii and i would be able to use my condenser microphone with it well long story short doesnt work but it is still usable with a pclaptop to record audio but we can do that with a builtin mic also would u like to pay  towards the presidential election
4149,3,shipping ordered on a sunday of week   placed in box on a friday of week  received it wednesday of week  whoevers responsible for shipping amazon or blue took their sweet time to drop it in this x boxbr br product currently testing the converter with a shure pg gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording i do believe the product is in working condition too bad i have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly
4150,1,i ordered this item on march nd  i expect to get its replacement from the people at blue sometime today  so whats a month anyway  the first one that came from amazon had a constant highpitched tone  i emailed then called blue and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem he allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect  thats always good to hear  so several emails later i received a return merchandise authorization and shipped it right back to them  who knows if this one works maybe ill like it  blues products look good but they make a strong case for buying locally
4151,5,this product is excellent for the group of people who have celiac disease  a tasty treat for sunday brunch the only problem i have is the cost butbr as we all know being saddled with celiac disease is not cheap
4152,5,so life with a gluten allergy can sometimes seem unfair however once bisquick started making this product things got a lot more equal it tastes like bisquick it works like bisquick hey it is bisquick it just happens to be glutenfree perfect pancakes enough said
4153,5,finally a gluten free mix that tastes great i have used this mix over and over and i have never been disappointed it works just the way the regular mix works and it has opened up a whole new world for me i thought i would never be able to find a mix that i like but this one i love i am excited about trying all the fun things i can do with it even cookies
4154,5,the first time we cracked open a box of bisquick gluten free and made a batch of pancakes i was surprised they were delicious perhaps the best pancakes ive ever had we did make a couple modifications from the box recipe instead of using oil we use the same amount of melted butter and we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as its cooking then serve with whipped cream so great im looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this including pizza crust
4155,5,i really like it when my wife makes anything from her betty crocker cookbook so i know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good  they are not overly dry like some of the other brands of gluten free pancakesbr br we usually have them with earth balance butter spread and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup  they are great
4156,5,a few years ago going gluten free was really difficult i missed the basic things i loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them i tried other mixes but the batters were very dry and required items to moisten them such as fruit etc but bisquicks gf pancake mix was surprisingly good it is a great alternative to the real thing certainly all of us gluten sensitives out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew but im happy to know theres a great alternative 
4157,4,this replaces many of other brands of pizza crust mix cake mix foccaccia and more  the only reason i dont give it  stars is that it is slightly pricey but that is an issue of living gluten free  enjoy and be creative with it
4158,5,as far as gluten free products this is awesome  i use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour  it makes great pumpkin waffles
4159,4,finallya gluten free pancake product pancakes not to bad taste like regular bisquick the batter is just right not too heavy pancakes this was a good price compared to local grocers
4160,5,this is a very versital product love it my husband must eat gluten free and my kids prefer pancakes made with this
4161,5,my son who has celiacs loves the pancakes you can make from these and so do iand i will eat them even though i dont need to eat gf highly recommend
4162,5,i have now served gluten free bisquick pancake and waffle mix to several of our friends and relatives i usually make waffles and have even done a taste test with regular bisquick and  people everyone liked gluten free best  i am so happy that i can buy it on amazon as it is twice as much in the grocery stores  thank you for carrying this great productbr alice miller modesto ca
4163,5,after searching many local stores to find this product i ordered it via amazon  i took the advice of other reviewers  ordered the  pack  ive only made pancakes w it but they are delicious  some complain that they are bland  i always add a little something to flavor my pancakes  a few drops of vanilla  a sprinkle of cinnamon had these pancakes tasting wonderful  my  yr old loved them  i highly recommend you try the gf bisquick
4164,5,ive been glutenfree for a little over a year and ive struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods the great thing about this mix is that its really easy to make affordable and the pancakes are so tasty my children do not object to eating themsaving me the time of making two batches of pancakes if they didnt see me eating them i dont even think my kids would notice that they are eating glutenfree pancakes
4165,1,been gluten free for  years now thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful  we threw it away because we did not like it for my money you cant beat pamelas baking mix but the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best so dont give up betty crocker just work on this one
4166,5,wow its deliciousbr the kids love itbr we made it for breakfast this morning the pancakes were eaten in no time at allbr the only complaint was that there wasnt morebr actually it was disappointing that the boxes werent bigger
4167,4,the first time i tried this product to make pancakes i thought it was terrible  i made it according to the directions and used the right measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy  then one day when i was visiting my mother she decided to make pancakes and since i am gf she had bought this mix for me not knowing i had already hated it  i saw that she measured the ingredients incorrectly as she used the same measuring cup generally used to measure liquids for both the dry and the liquid ingredients  she also used a whisk to mix the ingredients  amazingly enough the pancakes came out fluffy and i really liked it  in fact it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far  having said that both my husband and i are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products  however it is the best pancake mix that i have found so far
4168,5,best bisquick pancakes ive ever made  i think these are better than the original bisquick pancakes  my husband even loved these  i would recommend buying this product
4169,5,you wont find a better gluten free pancake mix out there  as a matter of fact i much prefer these gluten free pancakes to regular pancakes and i buy them for my husband  i love bisquick for this product
4170,5,when i found gf bisquik in the stores i was happy when i found it on amazon with a good price as a subscription i was thrilled our daughter lives in texas and is gluten intolerant so i mail her items on a regular basis this has become a staple in her kitchen anything you can make with regular bisquik you can adapt using this so now she makes cookies pancakes and biscuits to her hearts content taste and texture of items made with it are good
4171,4,it makes good tasting gluten free food but like most gluten free food its expensive and its got a slight grit to it ive made biscuits waffles and pancakes with it a friend made some awesome banana bread with it its very good for gluten free
4172,5,its great i actually used this to make gf donuts the other day i love how convenient it is its so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this i have celiacs and i havent had any sort of negative reaction to this i would definitely recommend this for anyone who cant have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things
4173,3,the first brand of gf pancake mix i attempted was bobs red mill and i loved it i went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so i tried it its okay im eggfree too and used mushed banana instead so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but i made a batch of egg ones for my inlaws and they said it was a bit mushy toobr br its not horrible but i prefer brm brand personally
4174,5,we use this mix for pancakes and waffles and its perfect we have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free the popular brands taste terrible so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes including breading for baked chicken and other things its definitely best as a pancake mix of course but using it as a starting point for baking has helped us find normal tasting gluten free baked foods 
4175,5,i recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes  i used it for biscuits and pancakes and its very good  you can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken  its about average for that
4176,5,i could not believe how great this mix tastedits like eating the regular one  it came out soooooo good fluffy and delicious
4177,5,i find it hard to express how pleased i was to find bisquick in a gluten free form  i have tried countless recipes using mixtures of rice and potato flour and none of them tasted good  the bisquick bisquits are delicious but unfortunatly i couldnt make satisfactory dumplings with the mix
4178,5,my son loves these pancakes much healthier alternative to the original i am excited to try the other recipes soon
4179,5,if you only knewbr br bisquick gluten freegf is by far one of the best options out there for people with celiac or sensitivity to glutenbr i honestly dont know how healthy it is for you what i do know it that it is a great option for people tryingbr to eat as normal as possible this gf option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosedbr with celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting gf options or super simple meat and vegetables options for mealsbr br we have made all types of breakfast items biscuits even fried food chicken tenders mozzarella sticks fried fruit we bout our own little frierbr br httpwwwamazoncomdpbnqqrefaslisstiltagtalkinhomecampcreativelinkcodeascreativeasinbnqqadidxkhzpjrkaedhewpbr br in short it has not only been a great option but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying thatbr it will taste bad to mebr br hope this was helpful
4180,5,i find it really hard to believe this is gf because it tastes better than any gf product ive ever had i made waffles with it this morning and i didnt even want butter or syrup it was that amazing i want proof that this truly gf
4181,5,this is a great product for us gluten free people  we use it for everythingfrom pancakes waffles to cookies scones cooking
4182,5,so grateful for this what an amazing mix it can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there what a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss real mixes some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does 
4183,5,ive tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet  thank you betty crocker
4184,5,thank you thank you thank youi have an intolerance for gluten and bisquick is my hero i have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but bisquick has saved me from myself again thank you thank you thank you
4185,5,my children can not have wheat gluten soy dairy eggs  it is very hard to find products that they can have  we use this for pancakes pizza crust cakes  basically we just use it in place of flour  it is so nice to be able to buy bisquick in the grocery stores now however it is much cheaper through amazon
4186,2,i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product but they missed their markbr br i made both biscuits and dumplings chicken  dumplings the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two
4187,4,my husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best  he loves this product and since i only really make the pancakes i cant say how the other bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you  and yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well  gritty sandy or off tasting etc etc  so i am happy he likes this one  with gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends  my advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages if possible  i know on amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you dont like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want  just a tip for all of you out there  it may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank  good product and great results  thank you bisquick
4188,4,i like the bisquick it works great in a variety of uses wish it came in a bigger box the recipes are good on the box though
4189,5,neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products but we love cornbread  this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us  nice to find an alternative that tastes so great  appreciate having this order size option as well since its often missing from grocery store shelves
4190,5,i love this  such a great product for all us gluten free folks  it works the same as the regular bisquick their website has tons of gf recipes too  this makes delicious pancakes and magic crust pies yummy
4191,5,this is great as a pancake mix  it almost has a corn texture to it  i rate everything by if my son will eat it  he is super picky and loves the pancakes  i tried making biscuits with the mix that didnt turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks
4192,5,great taste texture flavor and works well with any recipe wonderful pricing too gluten free products are so expensive normally definitely recommend this
4193,5,i received this item on time  the packaging was great  the gluten free bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry
4194,3,i was disappointed when i tried this pancake mix before going gluten free bisquick was our goto pancake mix so i had high expectations for the gluten free mix the texture was a little weird soft and dry i prefer the pamela pancake mix over this one
4195,5,i first discovered gluten free biscuit in the supermarket  i bought it and loved it  i then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets but could not find it  i called the manufacturer and they informed me that i could purchase it at amazon  i was thrilled amazon is one of my favorite web sites
4196,5,i had no idea there was a gluten free bisquick mixi made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also
4197,5,bisquick has made a wonderful gluten free product  from pancakes to biscuits and everything in between are light and fluffy garlic and cheddar or cinnamon and sugar is a great addition
4198,4,in trying to eat a little healthier im reducing my gluten intake glutenwheat may not be the best for arthritisinflammation so i gave this gluten free bisquick a try surprisingly i was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular bisquickbr br i followed a reviewers suggestion to let the batter sit for about  minutes after adding just the milk the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time it was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because i have limited gf experience i wasnt sure whether further stirring would gum it up so i left some lumps in and they dissolved while cookingbr br the texture of the cooked pancakes was very slightly gritty makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular bisquick however thick enough that id say they are just right see photo addedbr br i used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside  very goodbr br the taste is close to regular bisquick but a little more plain  i use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings i had a very good very tasty short stackbr br my only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but id rather buy this mix than other gf products ive tried that are just as pricey and dont taste nearly as good
4199,2,i love pancakes so giving up gluten was hard for me  ive used bisquick for pancakes for years with great results  alas the best i got from the glutenfree version was edible but not enjoyable  it tasted a lot like pillow foam not in a good way  i will probably keep the mix for breading things but not for pancakes  ive found much better options
4200,5,i have this on auto ship because i use it so much i have gone to every grocery in az and the cheapest place is amazon this is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great my son has celiac and is allergic to gluten i have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one i settled for
4201,5,this is a product that is delicious and easy to use i made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk the buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy i am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix i doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made br  inch pancakes  the recipe says it makes  pancakes with  cup of the mix those  pancakes must be silver dollar size  i am looking forward to making the biscuits so i will have to open a second box to have enough mix the recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and i never used eggs in my regular biscuits  i am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently i have family members who cant eat eggs or milk so i must adapt recipes for them it is a product i would purchase again however i used subscribe and save on amazon and the time to receive the product was really long in my opinionordered nov th received dec nd i know thanksgiving was in the midst of that time period but i thought i would have received the product before thanksgiving i will try subscribe  save one more time to see if all things are so slowa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdkbisquick pancake and baking mix glutenfree ounce boxes pack of a
4202,5,these tasted so good i was surprised because i have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products i would eat these by choice not because i have to
4203,3,this mix makes great belgian waffles  we tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard gf flour  it does make seriously great waffles though and we go gfdf on these  the waffles freeze extremely well and reheat in the toaster quite nicely
4204,5,weve tried pamelas second best bobs red mill and king arthurs gluten free flour mixes  for pancakes waffles breading pie crusts biscuits and dumplings bisquick has been the most reliable performer  we whole heartedly recommend it for those who bake at home but need to avoid gluten
4205,5,i found this product in a local walmart after trying vainly to find bread that i liked that is gluten free  stay away from the energ brand in my opinionbr br i have been gluten free for  weeks now and seriously craving bread products  i made some pancakes this morning from this product and wow  very tasty very light i needed to thin them a bit more to have them spread correctly but this was the first real carb product that was bread like that i have eaten in  weeks  needless to say i ate too many and now have a carb headache  br br seriously though this product used in moderation may help you not miss your gluten products quite as much  i look forward to making bisquits and some of the other recipes on the boxbr way to go on this product it strikes a home run in the gluten free market
4206,5,i made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend remade a family favorite from years ago chicken and dumplings which was on the betty crocker website under gf  we couldnt tell the difference between the gf and regular mix in the dumpling results  i made the recipe from scratch for six using chicken breasts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken broth baby carrots celery cut green beans onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving  husbie loved it
4207,5,i use this to quickly make gluteneggdairy free pancakes  i use rice milk and engerg egg replacer to make pancakes they taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge  theyre especially good weither apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup
4208,4,this stuff is pretty solid makes a decent enough pancake for being gf and makes a solid biscuit as well what we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the chebe mix between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix the chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy but when you mix it with the bisquick the bit of squishiness gives the dryer bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs so i recommend this but i would highly recommend getting some chebe too and cutting the bisquick with it also even though this mix has leavening agents in it when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway it tends to turn out better this way
4209,5,i run a small bed and breakfast and bought this product so i could prepare recipes for my guests that have a gluten allergy and they love it  there are many recipes on the box and even more on their website  quickeasy inexpensive what more could anyone ask for
4210,5,i have so many food allergies its ridiculous i am so happy that they made this product and that is available at a decent price i was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff i thought i couldnt have anymore i made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better they said it was lighter and had more taste i really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with thank you thank you thank you
4211,5,love this product  gluten free products have come a long way easy to use great for all your breakfast and baking needs
4212,5,this product is great for pancakes for baked goods i blend bisquick  part with pamelas bread mix  part for great glutenfreedairyfree treats the bread mix makes it less crumbly
4213,5,this product has helped our friend to be able to eat again  she is going to college and finding things to eat has been hard for her we send her a supply every month so now she can make her own food and not get sick
4214,5,you wont miss your old wafflepancake mix when using this wonderful product  i mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles  pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix
4215,3,it is good i prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch but for store bought its pretty good much cheaper in local grocery stores under  per box at my local stores in chicagoland area
4216,4,due to health issues my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet he acted as if he was on death row finding this product has help immensely i can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he doesnt feel he is being unfairly punished also my neighbor was faced with a similar circumstance i shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdkbisquick pancake and baking mix glutenfree ounce boxes pack of a
4217,5,i have only had this once as banana pancakes so im not sure how it tastes without fruit but it was the best pancake ive had in a long time  thank you for making a gluten free bisquick i will try biscuits with it next
4218,5,we use gluten free bisquick to make coated baked chicken waffles pancakes biscuits chicken pot pie  there are many recipes available to make quick easy meals  we really like it  everyone can eat it instead of just making a gluten free meal for the one person who is gluten free reasonably priced for gluten free
4219,5,my daughter has been gf for about  years now we have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour it usually isnt any good it is usually grainy this isnt the case with this product it makes fantastic pancakes the rest of the family would eat them she didnt like the biscuits so we wont make those again  we used it to make corn dogs and the entire family and a friend ate them no one even noticed everyone loved thembr br amazon has since taken this off of the subscribe and save i am so mad i hope they put it back on soon
4220,4,i really love this product i think it is a great overall flour replacement in your kitchen but i just felt the size was a bit small i would have really loved to see the box be larger i think there are three cups total in the box overall the product is amazing though everything ive made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via bisquicks website are easy to follow and come out very good id highly recommend this product to anyone my favorite things to make are the biscuits i add a little cheddar to them to make them oh so good and the apple pie which is more like a coffee cake but good either way give it a shot if you are gf
4221,5,finally a great and easy gf option for pancakes waffles biscuits etc from bisquick both of my kids have celiac and absolutley love this stuff  wish the container was bigger but were just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now thank you thank you thank you  cant taste a difference but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff
4222,5,thanks to the betty crocker people for this gf option it makes great pancakes and shortcakes for strawberries too my onlycomplaint is i wish the box was bigger
4223,4,i was so happy to find this product when it was first released i had used regular bisquick for years before being diagnosed with celiac disease this is just as versatile as the original pancakes biscuits dumplings etc my familys favorie is the pancakes they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outsidebr br my only reason for not awarding this  stars is the size of the box it is small my family of  uses the entire box for saurday morning pancakes the box makes approximately  small batches of pancakes we freeze the extra in single servings for weekday breakfasts id love to see bisquick release a larger box but until then ill continue ordering the pack a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdkbisquick pancake and baking mix glutenfree ounce boxes pack of a
4224,5,i really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy could not tell that they were gluten free i also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good
4225,4,i grew up eating bisquik so finding a glutenfree version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful  however a  ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes  i would love it if the gf bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional bisquik  especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones
4226,5,due to my kids food allergies i had to substitute eggs with ground flax with water and  cups instead of one of rice milk and some olive oil made great tasty pancakes
4227,5,i do a lot of from scratch gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace bisquick from the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that i cannot do with this little box
4228,5,i was really surprised when i tried this product because i found it to be a really light  fluffy batter so dont think gluten free means flavorless this bisquick pancake mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family its so nice that these are healthier for you diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too
4229,5,this gluten free milk free product is awesome i am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk it is great to have such a delicious  easy breakfast that doesnt make my stomach hurt
4230,5,im new to trying gf and most of the substitution products ive tried so far are okay but dont taste quite rightbr this was the exception  the pancakes i made with the gf bisquick were light and smooth and delicious  i couldnt tell a difference unless maybe they were a bit better a larger box would be better but the product itself is wonderfulbr highly recommended
4231,4,we found out last week that my son has multiple allergies including milk soy wheat tree nuts oranges tomatoes corn thus corn syrup and starch  we are in the process of trying to find ways to make what he likes to eat and still avoid thsese ingredientsbr br does anyone have a list of all ingredients before i spend  on this productbr thanks
4232,5,gluten free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free bisquickbr general mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brandbr br are you gluten free do you know someone that is an estimated    million americans are affected by gluten the protein found in wheat barley and rye grains and most do not even know it gluten is a toxin for many especially those with celiac disease autism diabetes multiple sclerosis crohns disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issuesbr it is quite challenging for those following a gluten free diet to find and afford products that are gluten free wheat is one of the most prevalent ingredients in the american dietbr find the best tasting gluten free foods at  exclusively we have been serving the gluten free community for over  years
4233,5,was very happy that the kids liked these we all liked them i bought this mostly for myself i made them with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil that it calls forit was a yummy healthy substitute will definitely be buying again
4234,5,hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes they were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it fyi i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe not gluten free and the measurements do not transfer the proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what youre making
4235,4,my family loves bisquick pancakes my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes the only problem is the price i will try pamelas this week price seems more reasonable
4236,5,i am going gluten free to test if i am sensitive to it it is a good diet to be on anywaybr br this was very tasty in a pancake it was light and fluffy  you do need to use a little more butter than usual but that makes it even better they  fried up with uniform color and had a nice little brown edge letting me know they were done
4237,5,it was worth the waitgluten free bisquick is just like the real thing everything tastes the way you remember it so make dumplings pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be
4238,5,i have missed bisquick since i became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free ive only made pancakes so far but they are wonderful
4239,5,it was wonderful  we made chicken nuggets  it was light and coated the chicken very nicelybr br i highly encourage you to purchase this  taste pretty much like regular bisquick  has many uses flour gravy pancakesexcellent way to stretch your dollar
4240,5,it tough to find good gluten free baking mixes but this one is smooth unlike some that are gritty and makes just as easily as regular bisquick it tastes just as good too
4241,5,i am so happy that bisquick came out with a gluten free version  weve tried so many other brands of pancake and waffle mix and hands down bisquick is the best  we just made waffles this morning and both my husband and i were floored at how good they were  the outside was crisp and the inside was soft  with that said its not that great for pancakes or coffeecake
4242,5,my moms impossible veggie pie was a staple in our house  especially once i became a vegetarian as a teen  as an adult i served it regularly to my family  ten years ago when my celiac was diagnosed it was byebye veggie pie  i do try to eat less processed foods but i really did rejoice when i heard about the gf bisquick  we had impossible broccoli pie last night for the first time in a decade and it was wonderful  the mix is just as easy to use as the nongf alternative and produces the same results  no crumbles  how often do you see that in a gf product  i bought a box at the grocer to test then went directly to subscribe  save here  this will be a staple in my gf kitchen
4243,5,ive tried a few other mixes for pancakes and theyve been awful but this one is really good i should buy stock in the co because people will be buying this product im sure
4244,5,i made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing i just added a little more milk and another egg we have chickens that lay very small eggs so  of our eggs is like  large store bought ones
4245,5,this is an excellent product and i use it just like i used to utilize the regular bisquick productit works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening
4246,5,this is a blessing to those of us who are gf  there are so many things we can make again now that we have bisquick  not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again  how nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again  since gf products are so expensive the best place to get it is at amazon on the automatic shipment plan  its great
4247,5,as tasty as the regular gluten product only drawback is that you dont get a lot of mix for your money half of the box is needed to make their  pancake recipe on a good note its nice to have options  by far though this was the best pancake mix ive triedand i tried a lot
4248,5,this makes the best waffles that i have had in years i will be glad to see more in grocery stores in our area
4249,5,a great way to make cheese biscuits for the celiac  i serve to guests and they cannot believe that my celeiac husband can eat them as they are sooooo good who says gluten free has to taste bad
4250,5,im the member of my family who needs to avoid wheat productsbr i like this even more than the regular bisquick mix when i make pancakesbr its taste is closer to that of my fromscratch wheat flour pancakesbr other members of my family have not tried it yet and i havent used it in  a pizza crust or biscuits
4251,5,we love the new gluten free bisquick i used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance now we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what i can tell allergen free the only thing i would like better general millsif you are listeningi know i am not the only one that wants this is if it came in bulk packaging just put the gf bisquick in a larger box like the regular bisquick and then sell in a  or  pack just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe gm will listen love thisorder now
4252,5,i usually make my own gluten free stuff from scratch and i love it but the days when i feel lazy i feel like using a mix and this one has to be the best one yet their mix tastes closely like the real wheat thing i have made the pancakes waffles oven baked chicken and strawberry shortcakes absolutely delicious
4253,5,our family has been wheatfree for  years and glutenfree for   so weve tried just about every mix out there  i just found that bisquick has a gf mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try  this is definitely the best mix that we have ever tasted smooth not grainy  i dont know that sidebyside with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference
4254,5,this is one of the most versatile mixes ive found and most recipes come out tasting very much like the full of gluten blends i like many am struggling with celiacs disease and ive only just found out i have it so im not quite sure what to buy whats healthy and what doesnt taste like cardboardbr br gluten free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way from giving up many favorites to training your pallet to love these new found grainsbr br bisquick is rice based and is very much like its original version however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the t when it comes to these betty crocker has a recipe website theyve published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats youll love when it calls for vegetable shortening be sure to use it for example biscuits made without shortening and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying even difficult to swallow use recipes that include shortening and will result in moist fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your mealbr br fun and tasty gluten free recipes for this mix can be found on the betty crocker website they wont allow me to post the link here sorrybr br update  fun tip about this and other gluten free mixes my mom figured out that when youre mixing together your ingredients and youre using one that calls for milk that if you mix together only the base mix and the milk and let it set for about  minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients the end result is much fluffier and tastier   this would be much like making tapioca pudding you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to activate the tapioca before moving on so i think that type of reaction is whats happening here with the bisquick mix yay for mombr br hope that helps you with your purchasing decisionbr thanks for reading
4255,3,rice flour sugar leavening  baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gum may include soy ingredients
4256,5,i have been gf for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives this one is certainly the best and the best part about it is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick the best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back i will be ordering again my only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves
4257,5,this is excellent  this is the best gf mix ive yet to try in over five years of trying it all  its not grainy none of that rice grainy thing going on at all  the texture of everything ive used it for has been excellent  this is a winner  the price is a bummer but the product is amazing
4258,5,i bought this product uncertain that it would be worth the money and quickly came to love it i made gf biscuits and gravy for my family and we didnt mention that it was all gluten free everyone loved the biscuits they didnt fall apart at all like a lot of other brands do i used butter flavored shortening and i think it made the biscuits even more delicious if you havent tried it yet try it now i now buy a box a week amazon has a much better price than i can find in most stores in vegas
4259,2,overall this mix is okay but the sugar content is very very high you can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely for pancakes or waffles this is fine but for savory concoctions this is not acceptable sausage balls casseroles and biscuits all come out almost inediblethis mix is also oddly gritty the grit is very fine but still makes my teeth want to curl  i recommend pamelas baking and pancake mix as it is smoother and much more versatile because its not as sweet a good cook knows you can always add more of something but you cant take it out if youve added too muchbr br that being said if youre traveling and this is the only mix they have its better than nothing
4260,2,i was so excited to get this and try it  unfortunately im not impressedbr br for starters the value is terrible  you get  cups of mix per box  thats enough to make  batch of pancakes and  batch of biscuits or  batches of pancakes whatever  for almost  a box thats not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best  for the biscuits i made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them  the pancakes were okay if i used twice as much real maple syrup as i normally dobr br the prosbr the biscuits did puff up nicely  thats the only pro i have
4261,5,the best gluten free mix ive tried  of the recipes on the box i can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable  the pancakes and waffles also freeze well  i also recommend betty crockers glutenfree recipe collection magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix from the magazine i have thus far made the chicken and dumplings the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good and the fruit swirl coffee cake i used a full can of pie filling per x i used apple and lemon pie fillings  i thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry  the mix is quick its easy it tastes good and it is versatile  and hey although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh
4262,5,my daughter was diagnosed with celiac about  years ago and has gone without pancakes ever sinceuntil i happened to come across this at the grocery store  really wasnt expecting good results  but its very good  the nonceliac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular  try it
4263,5,weve tried so many gluten free products and this one was by far the best ive made pancakes waffles biscuits and the chicken recipe for the whole family with this and they can not tell the difference pamelas is a good mix too but this one is much better it is expensive but when youve got a loved one who is gluten intolerant youre just thankful to have options for them i can find it at some of my grocery stores but not all you just have to check and see who carries it and then try a box its worth it
4264,5,i have been using gf products for the past  years and it is good to see more main stream companies getting the religion  the product works the pancakes and waffles have come out beautifully
4265,5,we cant say enought about the gluten free bisquick my husband and all three kids are allergic to wheat and we are on a strick gluten free diet in our house i have tried every product out there to make pancakes waffles biscuits and even chicken fingers and was so pleasantly suprised that this little box does it all and does it all wonderful pancakes are wonderful waffles are great chicken fingers are the best ive made and the biscuits are delish cant ask for anything better i only wish you could buy it ina bigger box and it was a little cheaper but we are a huge fan
4266,5,i love this i have celiac so this was the first time i had pancakes i loved them so did the rest of the familythey can eat wheat
4267,5,this bisquick gluten free mix is amazing  i havent had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now i just cant stop making thingsbr i just made banana bread for the rd time with this mix and my family loves it  i use it for everything i am so pleased  i made a cherry pie cheddar biscuits  ive beenbr using my old bisquick recipes from ages ago and it is working fine  i am so thankful for amazon and their items  i sure keep the ups guybr busy
4268,5,i love this bisquick mix  over the past  years since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant i have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad i ended up feeling like i might as well be eating the box  this bisquick mix is by far the best i have found for making scones plain or sweet and biscuits  the orange biscuits cheddar biscuits and raisin scones i have made were delicious it was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes because unlike some gluten free mixes i found i can play around with this and dont have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome  of course you cant roll this dough out like traditional dough it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls  i have found that if i dont make it too sticky i can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits i have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan  i use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesnt stick bisquick mix is made by the betty crocker company and this along with the betty crocker cakes and brownie mixes allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again  i have bisquick mix on subscribe and save which makes it very affordable and makes sure that i dont ever run out
4269,5,i absolutely love this product  being able to have pancakes was my original goal  however  i made the pizza with it  was absolutely thrilled about the pizzabr these are small boxes makes two pizzas per box but i would highly recommend  i am reordering a pack of three now
4270,5,wow  thank you bisquick for coming up with a gluten free product  i tried it and it works wonderfully  so far i have used ot for waffles recipe on the box which were excellent and a baked chicken and spike recipe which was also wonderful  anyone needing gluten free products will like this
4271,5,after my husbands enthusiastic reaction to the glutinfree bisquick biscuitsi rediscovered an old bisquick recipe booklet and used its recipe to make an impossible cherry pie he loved it next ill try the impossible pecan pie this is the first glutenfree product that my husband really likes  i will buy again although id like to find it packagedsold less expensively than on amazon
4272,5,i like the ease of this mix i havent tried anything but pancakes they were great i did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein which made them less fluffy but not less tasty i cant wait to try this mix for chicken i really miss fried chicken
4273,5,can as be used to make cookies  even egg free  i just used the mix enough apple sauce to make a batter some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked  turned out soft delicious cookies with only  minutes from box to the oven  however even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here
4274,5,this is really a great product  works and tastes just like the gluten product  our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products  we rate this crossover brand one of the best
4275,5,it was recently suggested to me i try going glutenfree to battle an autoimmune thyroid disorder  i bought the glutenfree bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible  the bisquick has far exceeded my expectations  the pancakes are light fluffy and delicious  i definitely recommend this product
4276,5,i was so excited when bisquick came out with the gluten free version but i was frustrated with the length of time it took for me to get a hold of some  i did finally order some through amazon and today i made pancakes using the mix  due a milk allergy i made them with soy milk the original flavor and i added a little double strength vanilla they were fantastic and my family and guests gobbled them up  i will definitely make them again and try some of the other recipes  a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdkbisquick pancake and baking mix glutenfree ounce boxes pack of a
4277,5,we just bought this the other day because for about  years we have found that biscuits are a very hard wheatgluten free item to makei love it i even went further and put holes in the middle of the biscuit dough flattened them a bit and then fried them in a bit of oil sprinkled with sugar and had doughnuts my  year old feels like he is getting a treat
4278,5,not gritty like a lot of gf mixes  i make the whole box at once and keep them in the fridge pop em in the toaster oven in the morning
4279,1,second ingredient is sugar need i say more make your own bisquit mix its super easy
4280,2,i made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best  i really tried to like this product but the taste is just so far off  for me  i wanted a break from making things from scratch but this just was not worth it
4281,2,i ran out of pamelas mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had  i followed the pancake recipe on the back  as a person with celiac who has tried many things i knew when i saw the fine crystalline mix it wasnt going to be good  the batter is pasty looking  the pancakes were too dense and slightly off  the end product was pretty bland  you will be much better off with pamelas mix  pamelas can be served to a gluten eater i cannot say the same for this product
4282,2,the rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade cheap if youve ever used thai rice flour a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeycthai rice flour   oza you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly grittybr br i tried compensating for the grit by using bisquick gluten free to make johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty but sadly after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth
4283,1,i made the waffles and was not impressedbr definitely not worth the expensebr br its only redeeming quality was that i seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chopsbr i would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch
4284,1,thought i had died and gone to heaven when i made the bisquit recipe  i was wrong went to indigestion hell  i had serious hope for this product i truley loved the mix but it didnt love me  i havent had indigestion since i gave up gluten until i ate a bisquit from this mix  best luck on getting it right bisquick
4285,1,i will first say that i have only tried making pancakes with gf bisquick my familys experience with these pancakes however was very disappointing and i will not be trying any other recipe i have tried betty crockers gf brownies and loved them so when i decided to spend a little extra and try gf bisquick i was greatly let down by the result we couldnt even finish them we just threw them out if you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products i recommend trying pamelas pancake mix otherwise if you are looking for great gf pancakes look elsewhere  gf bisquick is not worth it in our opinion
4286,4,i wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice i try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient denseplus lower glycemic ive not tried this yet but if it was listed as brown rice flour i would have put it in my cart
4287,2,my personal preference is to stay clear of this i did not like the smell or taste i was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time on my second attempt it came out better but i did not like the taste of it if i at least liked the taste i would buy again and make my crust very thin
4288,2,i bought these for pancakes and i havent used it to make any other recipes so i cannot speak for how it makes biscuits or any other item but for pancakes its a nogo they have a hint of pancakeflavor with lots of butter  syrup but i dont like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup so these pancakes are not for me moving on to other mixes
4289,3,the only complaint i have about the product is the price and i wish it were organic as well  other than that its a great versatile mix  ive used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler  
4290,4,just in case you dont know  these are about  a box at the store so anything more than  for a  pack is not worth it  this is a great product though thats what the  stars are for  the pancakes  pizza dough are great i make them all the time
4291,4,this product is so useful in managing a glutenfree diet  the inced price  amazon com makes it all a great buy
4292,4,in the summer my doctor suspected i had a gluten sensitivity she wanted me to start making changes from packaged food and think about cutting out gluten after a bad few months i did some research and found this bisquick i have only made one thing so far garlic cheese biscuits they were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor they had a more spongey texture than a crumbly biscuits but i was halving the recipe so maybe that was why i nibbled on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty i cant wait to try pancakes and coffee cake the only draw back is how small the box is for the price i will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat
4293,4,this is one of the best glutenfree mix on the market it makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread  also it is a great price  i have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best
4294,4,i used the bisquick pancake and baking gf mix to make snickerdoodle cookies  they were very good and stayed fresh for some time  thank you for offering this mix
4295,4,i purchased this while out of town  we used it a couple of times but never for biscuits  i did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good  always use milk and butterbr br they are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there i did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that  i used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good  i would like to try this again  for pancakes and make some biscuits before i make a final decision on it
4296,1,when i saw the ingredients on this box i knew it would be a disappointment it would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix also there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like pamelas and bobs red mill this will be a huge disappointment to you so dont waste your money
4297,2,reading other reviews i was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be gluten freedairy free  technically the dry mix is gfdf but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk  technically i can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then i could already do this with so many other mixes  ive found that mixes that request eggs andor milk really are better with the originals not substitutes  the best gfdf mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water andor oil or other nondairy ingredients  in this case i will return to my old favorite mixes by the cravings place  these are truely targeted for a gf  df lifestyle  that said if you are not df then perhaps this is a fine choice it would have been better to have a printpicture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great df option
4298,2,these pancakes are gross they are pale and do not taste like pancakes i bought these based on the reviews because the maple grove farms pancakes were out of stock that week i expected a lot more from bisquick i mean when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat if you leave them in a little longer to get some color they just get hard and taste worse i hate wasting food so i forced myself to finish the  boxes but i dont think ill buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock the only reason i gave these  stars is because they are gluten free other than that theyre awful im so glad ive got my maple groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry
4299,1,was awful the sight of this in my pan made me sicksmells like potato  duh potato starchwould not brown my child laughed the entire timeas i complained because i was so hungry and thought i could have a late night pancake session totally not the case  yes i am a gf newbie i tossed the box
4300,1,pure toxic garbage eat poison if you want to toxic metals go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison look at all the high ratings apparently people love eating toxic metals not harmful would you eat sodium mercury phosphate enjoy your metals
4301,1,a great idea that falls short bisquick glutenfree still uses an aluminumbased baking powder that is toxic to humans aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals the company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed
4302,1,i actually was delighted to find this product and my family and i loved the recipes made with it  however it has sugar as the nd ingredient and worse it has aluminum in it  why would i intentionally feed my family something neurotoxic when i am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy  i sure wish those companies who jump on the gf bandwagon would keep health in the equation  my kids bowel movements are gluten free too but i wouldnt serve it to them for breakfast  just sayin
4303,5,our family has tried just about every glutenfree pancake mix on the market bisquick is one of the best two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us dont but we all love this mix for our tradition of saturday morning pancakes the only other glutenfree pancake mix we like even better is a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbxprinuffins gluten free pancake mix  case of a its not always available on amazon but when it is we try to stock up nuffins is definitely worth trying their other products are great too otherwise its bisquick or pamelas for our familybr br the only con i can think of is the price at  per pound this mix is expensive if you agree mark this review as helpful maybe the good folks at betty crocker will take notice
4304,5,i bought this on a whim because i was craving strawberry shortcake wow the biscuits can be a bit crumbly but the texture is not objectionable the taste was great i use this for sweet and regular biscuitsbr br we also use this for pancakes and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes i add vanilla a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat yumbr br tip  ive found that most gluten free bread products work better if you let the batter sit for about  minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients it seems to activate the batter which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist
4305,3,i love this mix my favorite of any ive tried the only reason i starred it at  is because this is not a deal i can get  boxes at walmart for less than  dollars but i have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so ymmv
4306,5,i have used bisquick forever and now that i have celiacs i use the gf bisquick and i love it there is little to no difference at all between the two i have made biscuits pot pie and pancakes and they are all awesome i find most all other brands have an after taste and bisquick doesnt even my daughter who does not have a problem with gluten loves it and thinks its better than regular bisquick and she is only  i will buy this product all the time its my  baking mix 
4307,1,i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product glutenfree bisquick which is a shame because i do applaud them for their excellent cake cookie and brownie mixesbr br im not upset with them for for coming out with a glutenfree baking mix but forbr br  marketing it as though its an equivalent to bisquick andbr  for pricing it so ridiculously highbr br ingredients for regular bisquick enriched flour partiallly hydrogenated soybean andor cottonseed oil leavening dextrose saltbr br ingredients for glutenfree bisquick  rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gumbr br notice anything missing from the ingredients of glutenfree bisquick yup thats righttheres no shortening or oilbr br that was the whole point of the original bisquicka baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in  that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  that is why people buy baking mixesfor that specific conveniencebr br betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening or oil altogether even though shortening or oil is always naturally glutenfree so they cant pretend its a safetyforceliacs factor  its a costsavings to them pure and simplebr br heres the breakdown of what youre paying  a pound forbr rice flour  cents a pound at my local asian storebr sugar  for a  pound bag at walmart br potato starch also  cents a pound at the asian storebr baking powder  a pound at emergency essentialsbr salt  for  ounces of mortonsbr xanthan gum  for  ounce on amazonbr br yes xanthan gum is expensivebut very very little is needed a ounce box of glutenfree bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gummaybe  cents worth of xanthan gumbr br betty crocker is charging over  times what it would cost you to make their mix at home while eliminating the major convenience factor and cost to themselves but not to you of their regular baking mixbr br i dont mind their making a fair profit especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick  but theyre gouging us and being misleading about the productbr br make your own easily and for less than  of what they chargebr br since theres no oil in glutenfree bisquick you can easily stir up an equivalent make  pounds or more at a time with very little effort and it will keep for several monthsbr br or if you want a real bisquick substitutes betterbatterorg has a recipe on the site for a cupforcup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and nonfat dry milk powder  or you can use buttermilk powder or even vances dairyfree powder  it makes  cups at a time stores well and you dont have to use their glutenfree flouryou can use any glutenfree flour replacement you want like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum about  teaspoon for every two cupsbr br to find the recipe do a google search of betterbatter bisquick substitute master mixbr br boo on betty crocker
4308,5,when i first found out that my  year old i had to go gluten free i was a little worried about how she would handle it gf bisquick has made it a lot easier i have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers corn dogs pizza and chinese sweet and sour chickenwith this mix pancakes are also a big hit in our house they have quick and easy recipes on the box for the chinese i take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces and bake according to the recipe cook up some rice and just use a gf sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful
4309,3,having recently been placed on a gluten free regime i felt i needed some quick and easy help to get me started it works great but is way too expensive for what it is there were just over three cups of bisquick in the box when i read the ingredients i realized i could quickly mix up my own quick bread flour and keep it in the fridge im glad i tried this item because it taught me that i could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money
4310,5,this mix is great for biscuits snicker doodles and homemade chicken nuggets but in our house that is all we have been gfree for  years and yes i have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make a lot of gf stuff for everyone we love the pamelas baking mix for pancakeswaffles and sweetbreads and their flour blend the ultimate best out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes but i will buy this mix and yes i do agree it is awfully expensive for those three things ive mentioned and in a gf household usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste not one flour does the best with everything
4311,1,i regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy freebr however my last purchase was disappointing after opening a brand new package i noticed a black thing in the mix carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle i sifted the mix and found more dead bugsbr br this is the second time i writing this review amazon didnt publish my first review thank you amazonbr i will not be purchasing this item again
4312,1,i have been gluten free since  and this is i think the worst tasting gf mix i have come across i have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about i appreciate the effort anyone puts into a gf product but i couldnt buy this one again it was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes no butter or gravy just dehydrated spuds the only real good thing to speak of was the texture it was light and moist but i would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor
4313,5,i have been gf for years  i used this product for biscuits and liked them but were a little dry  as for the pancakes i prefer another product  the pricing is outrageous  i am single but cannot imagine trying to justify this cost when making pancakes for a family  i love the betty crocker gf cake mixes and brownies though  i still make my biscuits and oven baked chicken using this product  it is getting more difficult to find on store shelves so most times i order here  i have several bc cookbooks and have used the gf version bisquick  as substitute for the regular bisquick  some come out ok while others are not too good  i am learning to vary ingredients to achieve better results  my best experiment with this product was my scratch cornbread  i use gf corn meal and this mix to make a delicious bread  thank you bc for this product  work on the pricing  i would use it more often if i could afford it  tired of manufacturers holding gf people hostage because it seems to be the latest diet craze  gf people have to have these products to livebr br going gf saved my life and bc now makes products so i can enjoy baked goods again  i make my own breads using other products and now biscuits cakes cookies with this and other bc gf products  i also use this product when recipes call for small amounts of regular flour  it depends on what i am makingbr br as i am reviewing the product i gave it  stars  i give the pricing  stars
4314,4,this product produces excellent outstanding belgian waffles in my waring pro waffle iron  they exceed anything you may buy in a restaurant  truly  however at  per box the cost of the other ingredients you must add time to prepare and the small amount of product in the box i suggest you look at other glutenfree products from pamelas the gluten free pantry bobs red mill or arrowhead mills  you may see a better value for your food dollars  incidentally arrowhead mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare but i believe you are getting more product in the bag  feeding a family of  would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this productbr br if the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price i would have given it  stars safeway was the first store in san francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products  now however it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching  per box  forget it at those prices  hey its largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugarbr br bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat gf product in its inventory  i would certainly buy it

4316,4,oki just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits recipe listed on the box  these are not the kind that are rolled out  cutthese are drop biscuits  the results were very tasty  the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original but the taste is not as tart as the original  if you want a similar buttermilk taste you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe  i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right  i read the side of the box and it claims that there are   cups of mix in the box  servings of  cup each  the biscuit recipe called for  cups of mix i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i dont even have a cup of mix left in the bag  i know this mix doesnt have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup i would have used less but the recipe came out right  so there must be a misprint on the box  i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy smothered with butter  jam or sliced to make those yummy mcdonalds breakfast sandwiches by following the instructions i have a lot of biscuits  if you are single or just cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half  you will still have plenty and you wont go through the box so quickly  this mix cost me around  and i dont have enough left to make anything else without buying another box which i will because these biscuits are really really good  still if you are watching your budget dont prepare more than you needbr br about these biscuits  yummy fairly golden because the recipe calls for eggs and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges just like glutenous ones  without the eggs you probably wont get the nice eyeappealing color  even though they are drop biscuits you still have to cutin shortening or margarine if you dont have a cutter you will need to use a long fork  that is more difficult so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits buy a cutter  it will cost you as much as a box of this mix  the biscuit recipe also calls for milk so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick you will need to use buttermilkbr br the mix is made up of rice flour sugar leavening potato starch salt  xanthum gum  many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy  bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour  it is not grainy at all i repeat it is not grainy at all  for those of you new to celiac cooking using a starch such as corn potato or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that wouldnt be possible with rice flour alone  leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising  the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency  and yes they are necessary  as for the xanthum gum it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiacsafe baked goods a bit of elasticity acting as a replacement for the gluten  you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease  can you just make your own mix and spend less money  sure but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mixbr br the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes waffles strawberry shortcakes pizza crust ultimate chicken fingers and oven baked chicken  you can find more recipes on their websitebr br i recommend this product for the taste  i do wish that more mix was in the box for the price
4317,5,love this mix for pancakesbr many gf products have other ingredients im allergic to so finding something that tastes great and is convenient is pretty exciting i make a batch of pancakes and freeze individual servings to microwave laterbr just had the yummy cheeseburger pie for dinner last night recipes can be found on bettycrockercom
4318,5,it is very nice to be able to have biscuits again  i can only say they need to make a bigger box  we run out way to fast
4319,5,love this  its so good and makes perfect pancakes  love that its also dairy free  my husband who does not have gluten intolerance like i do likes them as well  hard to tell a difference between this and the gluteny versionbr br i love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods
4320,5,we have tried a lot of different gf mixes and when i found this new mix from bisquick i decided to try it  i made waffles for my family and even my kids couldnt tell they were gf  they almost taster better than my original wheat recipe  no strange texture or after taste
4321,3,this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of ricebased glutenfree mixes the mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatilebr br i will use the mix i have but im not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry im not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis which is usually a sign that this isnt a hit in my household
4322,4,i cant say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat  but that said for those of us needing gluten free foods its not bad either
4323,5,i just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes  i bought this and its amazing  just like the original bisquick  although it is cheaper at walmart
4324,5,when i discovered my sensitivity to gluten about  months ago i was dismayed by most of the horrible glutenfree foods on the market i have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me bisquick glutenfree pancake and baking mix is one of them i use it every sunday to make either pancakes or waffles i recommend this mix wholeheartedly
4325,3,i bought this immediately after finding out i could no longer have gluten from everything i was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anythingbr br the boxes are small  while this mix is okay for making pancakes the biscuits are alright and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is eh im glad i bought it when i was first diagnosed  it helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and bakingbr br now that i know what im doing i will not buy again  its much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes biscuits and breaking for chicken fingers  and my own mix tastes much better  but if you are new to gluten free definetly pick this up it will help with the transition
4326,5,the absolute best baking product of its kindi have tried almost all glutenfree baking products and bisquick gluten free is by far the best  a little expensive but worth the money
4327,5,for those with gluten allergies this is great the shortcakes biscuits pancakes taste much the same as with the regular bisquick my only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size would love for them to box it in larger sizes
4328,5,this is a healthy alternative to regular bisquick and works great in any biscuit mix recipe i will surely buy it again
4329,4,was on gf diet for about  months used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results still use it for varietybr a box goes a long way a little expensive but worth it
4330,2,i read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles  so i whipped up some pancakes breakfastfordinner style  im newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to gf so perhaps i should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before i start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods i used to love but i swear i cried a little bit when i ate these pancakes  because i thought they sucked frankly  they are completely bland and have no flavor at all and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste i dont know if thats gluten free but if so its probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it after letting the batter stand  minutes to thicken up a bit it was more like kindergarten paste but still totally flavorless  my  year old daughter gobbled them up so thats something  then i cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that i guess ill never get to teach her how to make a real delicious fluffy wheat pancake but thats a whole other thingbr br im giving it  stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken but you could do that more economically with another gf flour
4331,5,this is a great product perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good  also great topping for chicken pot pie
4332,5,this product is beyond amazing i have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades and for home use no other product comes close to this bisquick gluten free mix it is superior not only to every glutenfree product on the matter it is also superior to every other mix glutenfree or not on the market friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when i serve them breakfast so to everyone and anyone dont make the mistake of associating this bisquick product w other glutenfree products that result in food that tastes like cardboardbr last thought thanks to amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase since i can no longer find it in any south florida supermarkets
4333,5,this stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that i am actually allowed to eatbr my doctor tells me im celiac this was three years ago now i just hope i can continue to find this bisquick
4334,2,the pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores  it is not available in all stores but i have found it conveniently enough for my purposes
4335,5,these are really good i like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin i cant even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes its worth the price for my family
4336,5,weve been using pamelas for making pancakes and waffles but i saw bisquick and grabbed a box to try it  it made the absolute best waffles wed ever had  gluten free or not  pamelas has you separate the egg yolk from the egg white and made making our saturday morning waffles tedious  i added two packets of splenda to bisquicks batter and everyone including my superpicky kid came back for seconds  i was a little worried because the batter seemed a bit gritty but they baked up very smooth and fluffy  my husband made fried chicken from the mix as well  we didnt have any left overs of that eitherbr br way to go bisquick
4337,2,i am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily i was not a fan of the pancakes at all i believe they really didnt have a good flavor will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less not fair to us with allergies in my opinion
4338,4,i love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though so i wish they had more recipes available it does taste more gluten free than some other options out there
4339,5, cup gf bisquickbr  cup soy or almond milkbr  cup sugarbr cinnamon to tastebr br pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobblerbr br glutenfree bisquick isnt quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the gf crowd
4340,5,love these pancakes were something i missed the most after going on a glutenfree diet  years ago until now these are fantastic  thank you for making them i love amazon moms because i get these shipped monthly thank you
4341,3,the bisquick gluten free was okay but inferior to the bobs red mill and hodgson mill products pancake batter when made according to directions was watery resulting in flat pancakes
4342,5,i find the glutenfree bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original bisquick and i like the flavor just fine not much different than regular bisquick  its easy to make the pancakes just add milk oil an egg mix and pour on the griddle  cooking time seems to be about the same and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes  i would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing glutenfree products
4343,5,i was able to use this gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe i love it served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world
4344,5,my  year old son cannot tolerate gluten so i have been on a quest to find a pancakebiscuit mix for him that he will actually like i tried a few others and they were horrible i felt so bad for my son and kept looking thank goodness i found bisquick it tastes most like real pancake mix and my son really enjoys it i have made him biscuits too and he is thrilled to eat bread again  i highly recommend this mix for anyone who simply cannot eat wheat
4345,5,i have been on gf diet for a month and its hard to find food that taste good or even close to what i used to eat but when my husband found bisquick gluten free at the store the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up actually my husband eats the gf pancakes wnow even if he doesnt need a gluten free diet the pancakes are lighter and very tasty just follow the box directions
4346,5,this product is a must have for celiacs  the garlic biscuits and pizza crusts you can make are amazing
4347,5,product has similar taste of wheat pancakes without the gluten  even other family members not on glutenfree diet like it
4348,4,made really great biscuits even my nongf husband enjoyed them  my only complaint would be that the packages arent very big i used  cups to make a batch of biscuits and i dont think theres even  cup left in the package
4349,5,after finding out i had a sensitivity to wheat i searched for alternatives i decided to try this mix and make some biscuits wow were they good they sort of reminded me of challah with a slight eggy flavor they came out more like sandwich rolls rather than flaky biscuits but not quite as big im thinking of making them super size next time so i can slice them in half and use for my lunches after eating corn tortillas every day im glad i found something else i can have i also made an oven pancake with the mix and that was very good too i highly recommend it
4350,5,i tried this today with a recipe from my bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe they came out great my son who has autism and food sensory issues came back for seconds my  year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies the recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix they stayed puffy as i like my cookies that way anyway i experimented with one tray and refrigerated it it did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking will definitely buy this mix again
4351,5,nothing gritty and second rate here  they are just as good and the only pancake mix we use for the whole family gluten free or not they are that good
4352,5,ive never made gluten free items before and i got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake
4353,5,so being gluten free is hard especially in a dorm but i have gotten really good at making gluten free pancakes on an electric frying pan they are super yummy i also make these really yummy cheesy garlic biscuits this stuff is heaven sent makes food that is reminiscent of normal food
4354,5,i love this product after ten years of doing without the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic i too wish it was packaged in a larger box but as it is i dont mind devoting more shelf space to several boxes
4355,5,we have been living glutenfree for  years now and this mix is the best i have found  it makes great waffles
4356,5,it is hard finding similar products for our gluten free child for things she loved before being diagnosed with celiac disease  this is a mix that she loves for pancakes  she even made sweet potato biscuits yesterday with it we have found it on sale for  per box at our local grocery store less than amazon a few times so we stock up when it is on sale  it will be nice when gluten free foods are priced more closely to the wheat mixes  i would recommend this for you  we will try many more recipies using this product in the futurea hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdkbisquick pancake and baking mix glutenfree ounce boxes pack of a
4357,5,my daughter that is  and allergic to wheat refuses to follow the diet until i bought this now i make her waffles and freeze them every few days i usually get  waffles out of a box they are excellent
4358,3,alittle bit expensive for the product i think that it should be the same price as the non gluten bisquick and otherwise its good
4359,5,we use gluten free bisquick for many different things  biscuits pancakes etc  tastes good  lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family
4360,5,i just recently bought gluten free bisquick for the first time  it has been wonderful  i have to admit that i am addicted to their pancakes they are so light and thick and fluffy unlike homemade gluten free pancakes  they are absolutely delicious
4361,4,this product made wonderful pancakes  i couldnt taste the difference between this glutenfree version and the original i tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success the texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good
4362,5,i was happily surprised with this product i read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in betty crocker gf cake mix so i didnt feel the need to try this i finally bought it at a whim when i saw it at my local market and i am happy i did i am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends i have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when i find a gf alternative that cooks  tastes like the real thing another plus is that i can buy this at my local market which does not carry too many specialty foods and dont have to make the extra trip to the higher end storebr br i made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone will definitely use it to try other recipesbr only downside is the cost and size of box very pricey and very small
4363,4,this mix made tasty crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron but the whole box only made  waffles  this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price
4364,5,ive been gluten free for  years now have tried many bread mixes and i love this one  so does my husband who is not gluten free  i hope that everyone supports these bisquick products since big brand glutenfree bread and pasta products are so rare and so rarely good  it was something special for me when these came out if you can imagine waiting a decade for this youll understand  if those of us with celiac diseaseglutenintolerance keep enjoying them maybe the price will come down though its not bad now and they will offer bulk deals  it will also wake up other manufacturers  i would happily order a case or much larger package  i can make my own bread but i prefer to use a mix and use my cooking time for main dishes  so dont hesitate to try it i cant imagine being disappointed by this product  however i do find it for less at my local grocery store
4365,5,extremely happy with bisquick gluten free  i had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised  i always preferred bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years  i am happy to say that i can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions gluten intolerant  my next objective is to make the roll recipe on  the box  i wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country
4366,5,this mix makes the most delicious pancakes my gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs i have also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it so good
4367,5,i was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer sorry to say cheaper than it is sold here even with subscribe and save  first thing i made was my childhood favorite  dumplings  and they were just like i remembered them to be  the whole family was happy with them  they were such a big hit  i cant wait to make blueberry muffins this summer  i have never been able to duplicate the taste of bisquick with any other gf recipe and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same in my opinionbr br thank you general mills
4368,5,like the title says i have tried nearly all the brands spent a lot of money and in the end these are the best gluten free pancakes ive hadbr br i am not happy about the lack of fiber and the the starchy flours used but a handful of ground flax seed makes up for thatbr br i am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item duping the customer to spend even more moneybr br compared to the many other brands these do not have a funny taste or smell from odd flours these are made mostly from rice and potato flours you just feel normalbr br i hope they will come out with a whole grain version from brown rice and bean flourbr br tip to get the fluffiest texture use butter instead of oil room temperature butter
4369,5,i am a bisquick biscuit lover from way back and i thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah but i think they would be perfect using butter or margarine in place of shortening so i have hope as far as the cobbler goes i made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back which calls for butter rather than shortening as the crust it was amazingbr if you are expecting the ease of regular bisquick forget it this is not a just add milk and stir kind of product the biscuits require the addition of egg shortening cutting it in but it is easy and not too messy to mix with your fingers and milk also wish there was more in the box most of the recipes on the back require the use of the whole box
4370,5,i was so excited to see glutenfree bisquick my grandmother and mother both used it i fondly remember their strawberry shortcake so that was the first thing i made i almost cried it was so good i have since made the pancakes yum yum and baked chicken im a regular at their web site liveglutenfreelycom for its great recipes thank you bisquick
4371,4,i like this product and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store  i wish the box was a bit bigger but it will do  it is plain but it makes a light and fluffy pancake  you can add flavor with vanilla extract cinamon or blueberries  i liked the texture of the biscuit recipe but it came out more like a muffin  im going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it  i made my biscuits with butter  if you are creative with the use of add ins i think it would make good quickbreads but not the rising type
4372,5,my son just started the gluten free diet and i have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat he loved it i couldnt believe it at first but he kept eating im really glad that i was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast my little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good i buy it every time i run out cause i love eating it too
4373,5,i have always trusted the bisquick name so i decided to buy this product  i was thrilled with the pancakes and muffins i was able to make  the only thing i have a problem with is the size of the box  its very small  like most gf product you pay much more than you would for the nongf counterpart 
4374,5,thank goodness bisquick finally went gluten free  i have been  years diagnosed with celiac and besides pillsbury rolls pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits  we have eaten many pancakes since this product came out  way to go betty crocker  only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores
4375,5,my wife and daughter are celiac but my son and i are not we have been using bobs red mill gf pancake mix and its pretty good but you can tell its gluten free the pancakes we made today with this bisquick mix were amazing my mother my son and i could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor the texture is a bit different but theyre light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense gf versions well definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old standby regular bisquick recipes to see how it works in them
4376,5,this is a great product hats off to betty crocker once again they are becoming a more main stream goto company for people who are gluten free
4377,5,so far ive only had time to make waffles with this new gf bisquick but they were delicious sometimes with gluten free products you have to use other weird ingredients or processes to make them these waffles were super fast easy and seriously delicious cant wait to make other things
4378,1,going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optionaland definitely not recommended i knew something was amiss when i opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand putting my reservations aside i proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box needless to say the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange i would not recommmend this product for pizza dough
4379,4,the product is very good way too expensive and at almost  a box to get pancakes or biscuits i was disappointed
4380,4,my family is gluten intolerant and we use this product extensively  pancakes biscuits waffles it doesnt really matter what you need to bake this mix comes through  this is my go to mix above bobs and all others we have tried  try a box follow the instructions for pancakes and tell me they arent awesome go ahead i dare you
4381,1,bisquick gf is easy to use pancakes and muffins are verybr tasty the product is quick and easy to use it makes my day  gram
4382,5,i have tried numerous boxed gluten free flours and i never get the consistent results i get from bisquicks gf mix its also more economical than making your own who wants to buy  flours just to make a cake and this one never has that strange metallic smell others like bobs have i find myself making pancakes biscuits cupcakes again after years of going bread free due to a wheat allergybr br my one complaint is that i cant seem to find this in any local store i have my fingers crossed that amazon continues to carry this
4383,5,i have purchased san francisco bay coffee before i have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent the beans are always well chosen and slow roasted a very high quality coffee at a reasonable price
4384,4,the coffee was good but didnt have a strong flavor wouldnt buy this product again nice to try new products and try new flavors
4385,5,i had tried a small batch of the pods for my keurig and fell in lovethis fog chaser variety is just about perfect  i shall be ordering more beans so i never run out
4386,3,my parents fell in love with san francisco bay coffee company coffee which use to be available at our local az costco for christmas i looked every where for this coffee  found what i thought was a great value on amazon when i bought it  there was no image available should have been my first warning sign they had lots of pictures of the oz bags of coffee from the san francisco bay coffee co but i wanted something bigger and this was  lbs now there is a picture availble but if you look closely its rogers family company coffee who is technically located near the san francisco bay area so if youre in love with san francisco bay coffee company dont buy this coffee but on the upside since i waited till the last minute to buy it i gave it to my parents for christmas anyway  explained what happened but they said the coffee was pretty decent so still makes a nice cup of coffee just not san francisco bay coffee company coffee
4387,1,these sticks definitely dont look like ones in the picturebr they are much thinner and imho not worth the money i should have returned it but instead gave my dog gsd  at a time to keep her busybr br id stick with the redbarn or equivalent from another website
4388,1,i just received my order of  count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointedbr only valuepetsupplies bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness i beg to differbr the regular size is quoted as  thickness the product i received is less than  in thicknessbr out of  pieces less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertisedbr my blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute it usually takes him five minutesbr br on the other hand my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and wont leave leftovers for the big guy to clean upbr while i understand that valuepetsuppliescom sponsors good causes i will be spending an extra  cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat
4389,5,oue two labs love these and they are soooo expensive in the pet stores  each we got these in bulk for under a dollar each
4390,3,i have two mediumsized dogs and these are a real bargain but only keep them busy for about  minutes next time i will get the larger size
4391,2,i ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re small diameter size  absolutely true and i regret making the purchase for the same price i briefly ordered from a different amazon vendor the same  and length bully sticks for the same price  difference  original vendor bully sticks were on average  thick  this vendor bully sticks are at most  thick with most closer to br br what difference does it makebr br our dog a slender  lb mixed boxerchow would take  days to get through a  bully stick and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one  these new thin ones she completely consumes in less than  mins  that makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bagbr br will not order again from this supplier
4392,4,the thickness is just as described they are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated my  pet chihuahuas love them very much it usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so its a great time passer for them one negative thing id complain is the strong smell of the bag though i have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by this might not apply to everyone since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people over all id had given  star if it wasnt for the smell i have to give  stars for now
4393,1,apparently regular size  thinner than standardsized pencils   my chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick
4394,5,great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers  i cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs hash browns and this mix  more heat than you would expect have tried a couple other brands not the same
4395,5,with all natural ingredients and no preservatives all i can say is fantastic  there is no expiration date but i would eat this within a week or two  faster if its opened  absolutely excellentbr br you can freeze these with no loss of qualitybr br dont order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice  my orders usually arrive cool but not cold
4396,1,the ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason  they are brown mushy and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist  on top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugarbr br no living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul
4397,4,in my opinion these are heads and twos above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store  a lot of nice sweet pickle flavor  i probably wont buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges but if i ever see them locally ill buy a bunch
4398,5,i gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful jamaica  it has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy
4399,5,best grapefruit soda on the market cost is good but shipping is expensive i still buy it every now and then for a special occasion
4400,4,i was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these  i have purchased this brand at williams and sonoma before but always in small containers  i paid the same amount here for the bulk package  i am very happy
4401,5,what a steal  i make a lot of gingerbread cookies during the holidays  large ones  over  long  and i bag them in florist corsage bags  they look like you bought them at a fancy store  these decorations are the best and they are so cheap
4402,5,india tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at amazoni use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes  they will get a workout as the holidays near
4403,1,i have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it  im still able to purchase the oz at my local grocery  i was going to order this product but saw that it was  oz and was afraid it wouldnt go with the old duncan hines pound cake recipe  hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products
4404,1,in the past i was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix i made  rum cakes today thinking i had done something wrong when the first one didnt turn out as usual i now realize i didnt do anything wrongduncan hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product i would gladly have paid more for the larger mix now i will never buy another dunkin hines mix how dumb do you think we are
4405,1,duncan hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes i bought them all of the time but now they like betty crocker have downsized their packages of cake mix these new mixes will not work with older recipes that called for the  ounce size of cake mix that rules out a lot of our favorite cakes even a plain cake will be changed  it wont bake up as high or as big in the pan duncan hines just lost me as a customerbr br pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes at least not yet i will be buying them if they shrink in size i will bake from scratch
4406,1,while i think this product is good im disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from  oz to  oz has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight the  looks very much like an   same size box less product hmmmm
4407,2,i have bought duncan hines yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it  in the past it had  ounces  pillsbury and betty crocker have the required ounces   i bought duncan hines at safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after i got home i discovered why  i will not buy duncan hines again unless they go back to the  ounces or go to  ounces for   consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product
4408,5,it must be true because it says so on the package americas favorite cakebr br i seem to remember a check box on the  census regarding cake preference but i dont think i voted for yellow cake i would have voted for devils food cake although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention you know the devil so i may have voted for german chocolate cake but germany is you know the old europe so i  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake but without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they cant even serve  grams of salted nuts on airplanes sighbr br where was i hmmm oh yesbr br i certainly would vote for duncan hines cake but i feel it should be mentioned that this is not cakeyet this is cake mixbr br its sort of a cake fetus or a cake stem cell it still needs lots of development you have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake there is the promise of cake but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully you may not get cake depending on what you do you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charredbr br its complicatedbr br amazon has allowed thirdparty vendors to offer duncan hines cake mixes for sale for quite some time an example of this is a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbimskduncan hines classic yellow layer cake mix  oz   unit packa amazon being a very clever retailer has obviously read the numerous highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product and has now started selling these products directly to its customers so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience storebr br in order to enhance customer demand amazons copywriters have outdone themselves listing this products outstanding featuresbr br pack of six   ounces each now  oz lighterbr the moistest most deliciousbr a special treat for the special peoplebr br of course the special people must be those who voted for duncan hines yellow cake mix thats why its americas favorite cake makes perfect sense this is a democracy this is a great country and this is great cake mixbr br another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix this is enough mix to incubate a very very big sheet cake that would require a very very large incubator or oven you could also prepare a tall  layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the coit tower in san francisco certainly enough the moistest most delicious yellow cake for a very large number of the special peoplebr br finally a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product amazon suggests customers who bought this product also bought cottonelle fresh flushable wipes refills case of   s  ct obviously the special people anticipate getting down with this cake six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingersbr br a few cottonelle fresh flushable wipes could come in handybr br smart
4409,1,maybe i got a bad one  its very plain nothing special in flavor  i felt like i wasted my time and money i will not buy this flavor again
4410,4,thanks for having it sent to me promptly i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days
4411,2,i made one for my daughters birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning still tasted pretty good though
4412,4,ghirardelli isnt the finest chocolate you can buy but its pretty good and the intense dark assortment is both inexpensive and provides you a few possibilitiesbr br ive lately taken to unwrapping a   and  cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer to serve as an afterdinner sampler with red wine or scotch thats been a pretty popular approach a similar approach also works therapeuticallyif someones having a bad day sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate isnt a bad path to feeling a little betterbr br i do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag thats the only downside of course if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests youll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras darn
4413,5,many reports are coming out about how chocolate is actually good for you so eat more  this is the perfect chocolate to do that with  the varying levels of cocoa are perfect to help adjust your taste buds to eating dark dark chocolate its not an easy transition for a milksemisweet kinda gal but this chocolate is affordable and so tasty  i also like that i can just have one as they are individually wrapped and choose my 
4414,5,i love this sampler of ghiradelli chocolate intense dark squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz of dark chocolate each day that is over  cacoa  chocolate is a vegetable a friend remindedits a beanbr br these chocolates are affordable tasty rich intense silky smooth and just the right size  i love to serve them for after dinner  the squares are fairly large and individually wrapped  its great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests tastes  dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some  of course the darker the chocolate the healthier so you can work your way up to the  cacoa great to have on hand for the holidays  if you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation  im happy with one square most daysbr br these are a great nonguilty pleasure that are good for your health
4415,5,i got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift i like that the basket can be reused i have had the pasta before so i know it is good i dont know how the other items taste
4416,5, of these candy bars just might seem like overkill but you can always tell yourself that youre going to give them out to company of course the truth is that they are way too good to give away to anybody  they can just go get their ownbr br the good news is that they are shipped so fresh and soft that they will last till you can finish off your stashbr br theyre awesome
4417,5,this product is shipped so fresh that even if it takes your family months to eat their way through the box the last bitohoney will still be fresher than anything you can buy off the shelf at your local grocer  these are the large candybar sized wrapped in wax paper  because they are fresh they are soft like taffy and so a breeze to extract from the wax paper plus have the fullest flavor ever  enjoy
4418,5,theyre almost gone already and im about  pounds heavier but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the storesif and when you can find an outlet that carries them yum
4419,5,the bit o honey candy that i ordered took me back to my childhood when i used to buy the product  it arrived in a timely manner in good shape and of course it tasted delicous
4420,5,excellent quality and so o o fresha hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeaoobit o honey candy ounce packets pack of a
4421,5,i was glad i ordered this candy it still taste like it did  years ago
4422,5,i was just going to reorder the bitohoney  last me a long time and i enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth just like a kid
4423,5,love my taffybr shes so laffybr her name is bit o honeybr she gives me a kissbr oh what a bliss
4424,3,i found the candy to be harder than i had expected  it came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tastyjust takes more chewing to enjoy
4425,5,my neighbor and i love this candy and its difficult to find the  oz packets in the stores  so i just decided to purchase a whole case  they were fresh and great tasting
4426,5,best bitohoney i have ever eatenbr i have always bought this product at a local grocery store and it was always hard i figured it was suppose to be that way but after eating the box i bought here i now know better the candy was soft and deliciousbr i plan to continue buying bitohoney from here
4427,4,this is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake  each bar is sectioned into six pieces which helps with portion controland makes it perfect for sharing  my only quibble is that its sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy as its quite sticky
4428,5,havent had bit o honey since i was a kid  and seeing them on amazon made the purchase a nobrainer  and they were as good as i remember
4429,5,i hate honey but i love bit o honey candy i really dont taste the honey in them i like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat i like them hard brittle and chewy not soft this is actually cheaper per bar than where i buy them locally
4430,4,this was my second order of bit o honeybr the first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missingbr i hope mr sticky fingers found the candy as enjoyable as i did
4431,3,while i love bit a honey and dont regret my purchase i did not find them as fresh and soft as the other reviewers they arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth maybe its because i bought the bags of individually wrapped bit a honeys as opposed to the actual candy bars next time its the bars
4432,5,dried berries still with texture and the quintessential aroma pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture but in ten years trying to find them  gee so now i know to look for it on amazon
4433,5,again exactly what i ordered no fuss no muss arrived on time pretty much an ideal transaction only thing that threw me was that i underestimated the quantity gallon baggie in the freezer ftw
4434,3,berries are find but the package is bad unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor
4435,1,the food and drug administration fda is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs also sold as chicken tenders strips or treats may be associated with illness in dogs in the last  months fda has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from china these complaints have been reported to fda by dog owners and veterinarians
4436,1,be advised you will only receive  one box they are less than  in the local grocery store will not purchase again
4437,5,love these little peanut butter dipped granola bars  they are delicious  they are only one point on the weight watchers points system  even you were not dieting these bars are a great and filling snack
4438,5,we love them this is a great  calorie snack i snack on them throughout the day my husband and  year old enjoys eating them as well
4439,1,this product was absolutely horrible  each and every bar was obviously old because it was stale smelled awful and had to be thrown out  shame one you for even trying to sell such a product
4440,5,i love pico pica  it adds some flavor and its not too hot i eat it at least  meals every day its good on eggs its good on pizza its good on vegetablesbr br really you cant go wrong
4441,5,thank goodness for mexgrocer we love this pico pica sauce i cannot find this product in local grocery stores anymore  internet shopping makes living in a podunk town bearable no more long lists saved for the occasional trip to the big city i am on a first name basis with the ups and fedex drivers usps shipments are hit and miss if they fit in the mailbox great if not then its saddle up and head to town pico pica is our favorite product it is so good  love it
4442,5,this is a very different sauce  nothing like anything youll find in the grocery store its closer to the botique salsas that have recently appeared with the new taco restaurant trend its a little smokey my picky year old will eat a burrito with this on it my family always had this mild on the table in southern california and now that ive been transplanted in south florida i am happy to mailorder you can get the little singleserve pouches directly from the company too
4443,5,this company is an american classic been in business over  years why because it is the best hot sauce and taco sauce bar none there are some other good brands oout there but this is the best and nothing compares to it the hot sauce has reasonable heat and bite and adds unique flavor to your favorite mex foods the taco mild sauce is milder and just perfect on tacos enchaladas tostadas tamales bell beefers and frozen mex dinners the harder to find green sauce is to die for great on everything unfortunately i dont see the green stuff on amazon but you can find it just get it try all three i grew up with this stuff so am very partial to it i keep about five or six bottles each variety on my shelves at all times after you try this you will not want to go back to the run of the mill commercial stuffa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgghzqpico pica mexican hot sauce  oz  hotaa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbggipico pica  mild  mexican hot sauce  ozaa hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbdzmpico pica mexican hot sauce  oz  hotpack of a
4444,5,i gave this as a gift and it was a big hit  nothing was broken it was gift wrapped paid for this and even came with additional salt samples  i was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube  more than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each  it was well recieved and i wouldnt hesitate to buy again  i will say i think the shipping cost was a tad high but the salt was a good deal so it evens out
4445,5,i bought this product for a friend but i liked it so much im keeping it and buying a second one for my friend
4446,5,i ordered this collection on  and it arrived on  although it was was very wellpackaged this did not prevent the usps from managing to break one of the tubes the seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested as this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away i offered to pay for expedited shipping seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped asap the replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape my offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined in summary this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate i highly recommend both the product and the seller
4447,5,i ordered this salt collection for my husband as a christmas gift he absolutely loves it and has used it every night since this is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking i will be ordering the second collection for him soon
4448,5,what a great gift i bought it for a couple of foodie friends and they loved it it came beautifully packaged ready to gift i would totally recommend it
4449,5,this is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen  this is such a cool product
4450,5,last year i gave this along with a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductsalt cooking with the worlds favorite seasoninga to my foodie friends and family they all loved it the salt tubes were well packaged and i ordered  sets and had no broken tubes the package also came with salt samples which i really appreciate i have collection sets  and  on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit
4451,5,i purchased the old world collection directly from the spice lab as a fathers day gift for my husband  the item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule a small wooden salt spoon sample packets of gourmet salts and a referenceindex card with information about each of the  salts were included brett was responsive and helpful this is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices i will definitely make a future purchase and refer the spice lab to othersbr br update im disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered  the first time i used one of the salts i was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top the tubes should not be so fragile so i sent an email to that affect to brett the owner despite answering my initial email about how much i loved the gift and where could i post a positive comment he has not responded with regards to the breakage good customer service would be to follow up
4452,5,what a wonderful starter kit this is  while i am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts i certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time  tather than chance buying a product that i did not like and being stuck with it this allowed me to give each and everyone a trybr br i plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that like me are foodiesbr br this is an excellent product
4453,5,this product is great  and so is the company i had problem with the post office and they were right there to resolve the issue this is a great gift to yourself or to others
4454,5,this is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating  it has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collectionbr br there is a surprising amount of salt in the collection  in other words each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker
4455,4,purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends  it is great and attractive a note to purchasers we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns if you contact the seller directly they will work with you the seller send me a replacement vial very quickly and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it  will definitely get this set for others maybe even me in the future
4456,5,on sept i posted the following seller reviewbr    starsbr   im sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage on the top front edge of the rack there is what i would call a dent but its also rough from the way it was packaged i would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box i intended this as a gift and i dont have time to return it so ill just try to sand it down so its at least smoothbr   jammies september  br later amazon addedbr   message from amazon this item was fulfilled by amazon and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experiencebr br shortly after i posted it i received an email from the spice lab inc offering to send a new block i sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area they sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order the replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughterinlawbr br in hindsight i should have contacted the spice lab before i posted the review so they could have had time to resolve the problem i had jumped to the conclusion that id need to return the item in order to get a replacement which wasnt the casebr br since its a gift i cant speak to the quality of the salt but i can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive and the little spoon is a charming additionbr br i greatly appreciate the efforts of brett at the spice lab and i would happily buy from them again
4457,5,i got these salts for my boyfriend who loves to cook and love his salt the stand they come in is wooden and sturdy much nicer than i expected the salts themselves are phenomenal and i have already bought the nd set
4458,4,i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts and it was a hit with him it was well packaged with no breakage some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers the wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent i would recommend this for someone whod like to sample various kinds of salt and doesnt mind paying a high price the reason i gave it four and not five stars was the price
4459,1,four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken the product is apparently not able to be returned so i just wasted  dollars
4460,1,one of the vials was broken when we received this product but you cant return the product or get a refund  what a rip off
4461,5,this taste is between something like flax bread and cornbread excellent toasted with butter and jellydid not raise my blood sugar at all i love it
4462,5,i just had a wonderful dinner fresh fluke fried in a tempura batter the batter fried up perfectly lacy and crisp both delicious and beautiful and lowcarb i floured my fish with the lc foods pan bread flour and then used the same flour to make a batter with some lowcarb beer salt and a little smoked paprika an absolute knockout you really wont believe its low carb but im about to test my blood sugar levels and will report back in  minutes
4463,5,my friend who lives in fla told me about these french twists and was complaining that she couldnt find them here in middletown oh  i ordered  boxes to see what she was raving about and found only one problem with themi couldnt stop eating them  i ate  boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so i wouldnt eat it too  if a person can stop after eating  or  servings they are a great addition to your diet  unfortunately i couldnt stop
4464,5,these french twists are delicious  i am on weight watchers and  of these twists have a one points plus value  all the flavors of these are fantastic  you can eat cookies and still be healthy  please barrys bakery never stop making these  the price on these through amazon cannot be beat  i have paid from  to  per box in the supermarkets  i will be ordering another case soon
4465,5,love these snacksgreat for a quick fix as well as a snack that doent add the huge calories or fat that concerns many great taste as well as consistency
4466,5,i saw these in our local commissary one day and decided i had to give them a try  i was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth  i had no idea how much i would like these and have to have more  i got one bag of the raspberry and one bag of the maple and i love them both  im thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods especially than the ones i normally choose  i am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item  i love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so i can enjoy them more often  they are light and flaky and satisfying and gooda must for me
4467,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbigoobarrys bakery french twist wild raspberry ounce box pack of abr br i really love this product  it is not available in our area  we discoverd it in the north while visiting friends it is low cal and good for diabetics who need a sugar fix  keep a good supply for future orders
4468,5,i have bought this product before these snacks are crisp and great tasting also low in calories i recommend them highly they are shipped almost instantly and arrive within a few days
4469,5,these shortbread cookies are delicious  i bought some while in london this summer  they are hard to find and expensive in usa
4470,5,everything i bought was great infact i ordered twice and the third ordered wasbr for my mother and father
4471,5,i sent two babkas to a friend as a thank you  he is a big seinfeld fan so he was thrilled to get both a cinnamon and chocolate babkabr br he said the babkas were delicious
4472,5,this is a great product great flavors and very fresh i received it quickly and damage free it is my opinion that this is a great value and i highly recommend it
4473,5,at first i was concerned about ordering babka online but i kinda missed this one as i tasted it the only thing i could say was  wow i will order this again for sure
4474,5,wonderfully cinnamony i will definitely be ordering it again and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste
4475,5,looking forward to receiving this product and when it arrived it was covered in walnuts  unfortunately tree nuts are an issue and i wish that there was information about nuts on the items listing  i will bring it to work for the staff to enjoybr br addendum  staff loved the babka  picture of product now shows nuts on top prior listing did not   stars for the babka and  stars for the lack of ingredient list at least major allergens
4476,2,while the flavor and quality of this chili is great the ounce can is mostly liquid the number of servings is listed as  but the reality is that it will only serve about  unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated i wont be purchasing this again
4477,5,love this stuff  i add some diced tomatoes and a pound of ground hamburger and this is great  i take it to pot lucks a lot
4478,5,you cant beat the price and taste of this coffee it will always be my first choice to buy my husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat little did we know it would become our new favorite
4479,5,cant  go wrong with this  remember its jingle  better coffee a millionaires money cant  buy  always priced right and in this economy thats  not always easy  frankly i prefer it over starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on one cup of coffee
4480,1,b u r n e dbr br i read the other two reviews and didnt heed their warning thats on mebr br they are usable but they were certainly burned
4481,1,i cant believe i wasted almost  on this they were burned they were inedible it was so nasty and they took forever to arrivebr you should take this product off of your product list worst product ive ever ordered
4482,1,i purchased  boxes as gifts at  per box  i spent over  and none could be used  every piece was broken and could not be used for the seder  sending a gift that is broken and cant be used is very embarrassing  also the return window is april th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first seder which was on april th at night
4483,5,every revolution product i have tried has been a wonderful experience  revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyablebr br better than the restbr br ive been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now and i simply love it no other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste  for example trader joes store brand while good seems as if it has been sweetened to the point where its too sweet and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added i didnt check the ingredients so i may be wrong about this  theres also yogis pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste i liked it didnt love itbr br complimenting flavorsbr br pomegranates are often compared to apples  in fact pomegranate means seeded apple from latin pomum  apple and granatus  seeded and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart but has a very strong and distinct flavor  thus a light white tea is the perfect companion it doesnt overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue  likewise the amount of pomegranate or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor is truly perfect  no flavor overpowers the other but rather all the flavors compliment one anotherbr br brewingbr br im sure someone out there will say that im butchering tea when i brew this but when i do i leave the tea bag in the mug until ive consumed it all  i find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter  typically this is only the case for herbal teas which dont become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves  in this case the same is true perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light the tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds flesh included  do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed if you dont try it its wonderful  that initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get or at least i get from a pomegranate is captured in this tea and it makes sense theres pomegranate seeds in therebr br conclusionbr br buy this tea  i was a little skeptical about my first purchase since i was buying  boxes but it was a great choice that i do not in the least bit regret  ive bought this for myself and for family with everyone absolutely loving it best  i have ever spent and continue to spend
4484,5,enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste  the count pack of  represents an excellent buy compared to store prices
4485,5,i love this tea  i have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives  i have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea  i take it to the office and i have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants
4486,1,this is the first time we bought this tea from amazon we used to get it directly from revolution tea i dont know if that made any difference or if it was just a change in the teas composition along with the packaging but what used to be my wifes favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong almost cheapgenericgreentea flavor really disappointing especially since were stuck with six boxes
4487,5,as an exbrit steeped pun intended in strong black tea i wasnt sure about this but revolution white pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious light yet flavorful  the low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of courseiced tea i hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it
4488,3,the flavor is very mild  we tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant  would not purchase again
4489,1,trader joes pomegranate white tea is superior to this tea this is very bitter and perfumey maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems  i found it repulsive
4490,5,revolutions teas are superb smooth and delicate each one has been pleasant comforting and a pure delight ive tried this one the pomegranate as well as ginger peach dragon eye oolong and white pear
4491,4,i purchased this tea for someone who enjoys trader joes white pomegranate tea and unfortunately it was not a good substitute though i havent tried it myself i was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable  i am rating  stars since this is such a subjective judgement and i have no doubts about this being a high quality product
4492,5,ive been using this tea for for about  months and drink it as iced tea dailybr br i microwave my water on high in a pyrex  cup glass container for  minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about    minutes i use about    bags for a rich taste and since im going to be pouring it over ice i put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice grab a straw and its ready to drinkbr br it also tastes good when i steep  bags of the revolution white pomegranate tea with  bags of the arizona pomegranate this is my favorite on ice the arizona is a green tea anyhow this is my usual lunchtime pick me upper i want to note that i gave up drinking diet soda in march and has made this concoction my replacement it was a little difficult at first but now that awful stuff is out of my systembr br i have not tried this tea hot as i am not a fan of hot tea but im sure its just as delicious i subscribe to this and the arizona pomegranate green tea
4493,5,this melitta decaf riviera sunset coffee has an excellent taste  there is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees  its a smooth mellow taste even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa  i really enjoyed this  the grind is listed as extra fine but i didnt find it particularly fine myself  when i grind my own beans i have a finer grind than this but i still expected a stronger taste from the melitta than i would from other store brands  however the melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried  we like our coffee strong about  cup ground coffee for  to   cups water using measuring cups  this ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the melitta but that is easily adjustable  the nice thing about the coffee is that even when i made it very strong the smoothness remained  i will definitely be trying other types of melitta coffee in the future
4494,3,im not a coffee expert but i know a good tasting coffee when i drink a cup the melitta riviera is a light roast with a nutty and creamy flavor the aroma is just exhilarating it left a nice aroma throughout the house almost made it seem like i was in a coffee shop unfortunately it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt i need in the morningbr br the packaging caused some problems for me the seal is excessively tight ive never had this problem with starbucks dunkin donuts peets coffee or meijer packs with the melitta it was so tight that when i did open it the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor one could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor i could argue that if it were easier to open i wouldnt have spilled maybe  days worth of coffee grounds onto the floorbr br pros light roast excellent aroma nutty and creamy tastebr br cons decaf arggghhh and hard to open packbr br overall 
4495,5,the minute you open a bag of melitta riviera sunset you will think you are in starbucks the rich aroma is intoxicating a promise of things to come i like my coffee a little stronger so i used a â¼ cup ground coffee with ounces water after brewing the coffee my entire apartment was heavenly scented with a superior fragrance the first sip was like falling in love i literally felt heady the only thing i added was a little half  half and two packets of stevia i would highly recommend that you have this coffee after dinner with your dessert this is truly an exceptional coffee im beyond impressed now im eager to try the melittas parisian vanilla ground coffeebr br the rebecca review
4496,5,melittas rich flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag it is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour highly recommended
4497,4,this is pretty decent coffee for preground decaf  heres how a coffee snob reviews itbr br  unpacking br this coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house and it was hot out  heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee  the package was pretty hard to open i resorted to scissors  the grind is very uniform with no detectible dust  the smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted nondecaf beans i usually buybr br  brewing br i busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a melitta filter  i poured two cups of f water through  the uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee didnt clog as it does with bladeground coffee due to dust  i drank the coffee blackbr br  tasting br the smell is of decaf and or instant coffee  pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame  overall i enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf ive had recently  there was no biting bitterness  i drank two cups black without much of a gut achebr br prosbr  tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshnessbr  excellent grind uniformitybr  low bitternessbr br consbr  not locally roastedbr  not fresh bestby date is a year in advancebr br verdict for mailorder preground decaf this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable   or  stars
4498,5,i love coffee  i love coffee a lot and really dont enjoy decaf  this decaf isnt bitter though  tastes smooth and brews up very nicely  enjoyable to the last drop
4499,5,this melitta cafe collection rivierasunset blend coffee is so full flavored its much better than other decafs we have tried and really tastes like regular coffee which is great because awe enjoy aided coffee ian the summer so no worries about it keeping us awake all night recommended
4500,4,this melitta riviera sunset decaf makes a betterthandecent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite i used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a bialetti stovetop espresso makerbr br while i was enjoying the coffee i read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water that got my curiosity up so i measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon since i use two heaping scoops thats slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package following the directions would probably make a watery undrinkable brewbr br the coffee has a nice even espresso grind perhaps a bit lighter than a french roast i would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but melitta states that it is an allarabica blend from central and south america it is decaffeinated through the chemicalfree swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as i am concernedbr br also note the cute vintage travel posterstyle label and the clever name because its decaffeinated its perfect to drink while watching the sunset
4501,3,i have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee but in my opinion this stuff is mediocre coffee i drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee i am normally a fan of the swiss water decaffeination process decaf coffees and was disappointed by the quality of this gourmet coffeebr br with that said i did try this twice to give it a fair review the first time i prepared it the same way i normally make my coffee on the strong side the second time i followed the directions exactly both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the melitta style cone filter to my taste it was stale and overground like the flavor was watered out of it and then overroasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it comparable in quality to lowend bulk coffee the brands of decaf coffee i do like and brew at home dunkin and newmans own to name only two are in the same price range and also purchased preground but to me taste much smoother and more fullflavored this coffee is not one i would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality
4502,3,the price is great but i just didnt like the taste of this coffee im pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong this one produce very acidic coffee when made strong but if you make it thin then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste how youd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee but if you are like me drink coffee strong or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while then this is not for you
4503,4,the main reason i drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening  my caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning only one cup  so this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since i wont get wound up  flavor is good packaged well easy to brew
4504,5,an excellent bold medium blend of decaf coffee for a special evening dark enough without being bitter and a perfect compliment for a light desert
4505,4,i had never heard of this coffee before but i got a bag and really liked it  this melitta cafe riviera sunset decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body  this stuff is perfect for a latenight cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert  its decently priced and i will definitely buy this again
4506,3,i thought this would be a great decaf option but the flavor is a lot milder than expected i use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor a bit better than instant for late night sippers like me
4507,4,melittas riviera sunset decaffeinated ground coffee turned out to be a good basic coffee  not bitter not burnedtasting a wellrounded mellow brew that tastes like real coffee i had it this morning with almond milk stevia and a pinch of cinnamon and though id had a bad night and didnt even know if i could handle coffee it was delicious and easy on a morning tummy besides brewing it alone to get a nice decaffeinated coffee for nighttime drinking especially in the winter weve been mixing it with regular coffee in various blends depending on our caffeinerelated needs at the timebr br the packaging is practical and easy to reclose and the grind is good for my automatic coffeemaker i will buy this one again
4508,3,i remembered that melitta was a very fine ground and thought it would likely go well in my coffee makerbr br but after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself the melitta came up average at best  better than maxwell house though
4509,5,i like this coffee it smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells for a decaf coffee it is very goodbr will definitely buy this at my local store
4510,5,this stuff tastes great i am not a decaf person but perhaps i am being won over by melitta coffee  try it
4511,4,i love coffee and admit that i am particular when it comes to good coffee  i was not expecting much from this coffee and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was quite good  it falls into the likes of starbucks and other shadegrown coffee brands  deep rich flavorbr br though i enjoyed it i am not sure i would purchase this unless it was on sale  i do find it a bit overpriced  if you dont mind spending the money you will be happy with this coffee  otherwise i would suggest purchasing this on sale for a special occasion
4512,5,wonderful smooth satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor  no chemical aftertaste like many decafs ive tried  apparently the swiss water process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact something ive found terribly disappointing in other brandsbr br ive been very impressed by the flavor dimensions of this riviera sunset blend served it to some neighbors who simply wont touch decaf coffee who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf  no bitter notes my husband who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf has been asking for a cup of this every evening after dinner  believe me this alone is quite an endorsementbr br i love using my a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbszojirushi cdwbc micom electric liter water boiler and warmer champagne golda for coffee tea and cooking  i brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual melitta brown paper filter a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeetmelitta cone coffee filters natural brown no  count filters pack of aand filter cone similar to this onea hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbqsready set joemuga and found that the extra fine grind of the riviera sunset blend imparted an unusually rich deliciously multidimensional flavor  much fresher than conventional bythepot coffee  this method also allows me to brew strong coffee for me and a milder version for my hubbybr br take time to bloom the grounds first add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds moistening completely and then wait about  seconds before brewing for best flavor this goes for any coffeebr br melittas riviera sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob  youll love it as is no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor  i look forward to ordering morebr br update   just ordered my first pack through subscribe  save great deal for some delicious decaf
4513,4,i enjoy my coffee with plenty of sugar and a flavored creamer this provided a good base for that experience as a nonconnoisseur this is just about right not too strong not bitter good coffee flavorbr br for the sake of comparison i most often drink the ground version of a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeqmmeight oclock coffee  decaf whole bean ounce bags pack of a right now on amazon melittas is slightly more expensive per ounce though subscribe and save would even it out and melittas brewing instructions call for using a smaller amount of grounds i would expect them to be about the same quality and in my opinion they were this is certainly a coffee im happy to drink when i want decafbr br one downside is the bag my husband got to it before i did but he reported that it required scissors to get it open the resealing feature on the bag then couldnt be used so we made the transfer to another sealed container
4514,5,my wife and i both thought this is a nice cup of coffee the bag has a oneway valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat when brewed in our cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a  nice aroma i take mine with cream and sugar and mrs b drinks hers black we both thought it was smooth with no bitterness later it made a nice after dinner coffee when we added our favorite liquor tho i am no coffee snob i can tell a good cup of coffee from a bad one and this one makes the grade
4515,3,this ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine brew with a rich aroma and flavor it is smooth and satisfying with a fullbodied taste my wife and i loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee for an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water you could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire i generally drink decaffeinated folgerss brand and when i compared the two brands i did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee you may want to consider the price variance between the two brands before you want to purchase this product
4516,5,i do not like coffee too much actually i am very particular about coffee and i can say that this is one of my favorites it is so smooth and flavorfulthe smell is really good and i cant have enough of iti have gone as far as skipping going to starbucks or dunkin for coffeebr the price is decent for this kind of product so i highly recommend it
4517,4,first off  let me state that i am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type  but i often have guests over who ask for decaf so i gave this a trybr br while i agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain different taste about this blend for me it was not a bitter taste but instead a good strong flavor that mimicked the strong real coffee taste i enjoy  i had a second cup and the flavor grew on me even more and i thought it really is delicious for a decafbr br the aroma isnt truly satisfying why does this always happen with decaf but i think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lackbr br the package had to be snipped open with scissors this is tightly packed and then i just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridgebr br ill stick with regular coffee but im sure my decaf loving friends will enjoy this
4518,5,i am a coffee lover it is one of the few pleasures of my life so i was excited to review this product  once received i opened it up and gave a good sniff  i know to some that may sound stupid but i love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me this coffee did not do that as much as others that i have used  i had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma but it smelled pretty good once i got my nose in therebr br i set out to brew myself a pot  i followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me  now usually i do not drink decaffeinated so i was just a little concerned decaf to me can taste very flat but i waited and a nice smell filled the air  finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product my husband smiled he loves any coffee that has arabica beans he looked at me and said ummm this is really good  my turn  i sniffed some more im a real sniffer before anything goes into my body  it still smelled pretty good so now for the taste testbr br okay it was definitely different than the dunkin  donuts coffee that im use to and love howeverit had a smooth flavor but  a little richer than i like and i didnt seem to notice that it was decaf that was a good thing  it was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee  hubby liked it a lot so i would have to say it was a winner a good rich coffee flavor and a good price
4519,4,im a big coffee drinker much against my better judgement but due to a stomach condition ive been forced to drink mostly decaf for the last few years i usually just get the cheapest coffee i can find near my office after all i dont make a lot of money and every penny counts so it was nice to get this melitta cafe ground coffee to samplebr br when i made my first cup i was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma i put in a little cream and  splendas as i usually do and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter maybe its because this is decaf but what i did like was its pureness something cent coffees usually lack i have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days ive grown to like this coffee granted to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness but even i can tell this is gourmet coffee much better than the ones i get at my local coffee stands or even at mcdonalds when they give out free cupsbr br for a pack of  the price seems decent if you drink decaf i think this is quite worth a try
4520,3,not much of a decaf drinker unless i am craving a cup late night for some reason i have to say this coffee tasted average at best i am a wawa coffee fan and coming from them to this well it missed the mark i gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it so  stars in that respect i might try mixing it with my nondecaf coffee to see how it tastes but i am not holding my breath if the price was a few  cheaper definitely would bump it up a star
4521,3,if you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race this is not the coffee for you it is quite flavorful so i do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee
4522,4,i would recommend this as a good basic coffee  it has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee  i prefer drinking my coffee black and i found this to be produce a good cup  it is not bitter and even though i had the decaffeinated coffee it did not taste flat like so many decafs do
4523,4,my wife finds it bizarre that i enjoy a good cup of joe just before i call it a night yeah sometimes i get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so i thought id give this decaff a go what you get is a good cup without any bitterness but its a little weak and i recommend dropping about  more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor also as its vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat  nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot i know its a minor thing to complain about but i like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item wouldnt even stand up it was about  thickbr br so youre not going to have mr wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it aint half bad
4524,3,like most melitta brews i found this one to be somewhat middle of the road  its certainly not undrinkable but its not the first one id reach for either  as many of the other reviewers mentioned i did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown i think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup so take that into consideration when figuring the valuebr br im a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day and i bought this primarily to use with my mr coffee frappe maker a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbfwmfgmr coffee bvmcfm ounce frappe makera let me just put in a quick pitch for that i love it  i found the riviera sunset stood up well to all the milk flavoring and ice inherent in making a frappe again with a significant increase in the amount usedbr br i would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee i look for birdfriendly fair trade brands and i find nothing to indicate that melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations  leaving aside these considerations though i think those who enjoy a somewhat light easydrinking brew would like this coffee
4525,3,okay im a complete coffee nut ive even been known to grow my own beans and when i run out of my private label i tend to enjoy the baddest kona or jamaican blue mountain i can findbr br still sometimes i just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss and this is what i was hoping for in the melitta riviera decaf to a good degree i was happy with it but its certainly not something id curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffeebr br the positives are the aroma the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste which id rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side i found i liked it best either in a french press or in my viviano espresso maker  two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee brewed conventionally i found i could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usualbr br still although not a serious competitor to the worlds best coffees it doesnt cost  a pound either id have to say that for the price its definitely worth trying
4526,5,great not like other decaf which seems to hav a weird taste to me if you keep trialing different decafs to find one you like definitely give this a try
4527,4,i like the smooth taste of this coffee it is decaf so not too strong but really not very light either its just the light coffee that sometimes needed at midday recommended
4528,4,this is good for packaged ground coffee and for decaf it definitely has a strong coffee flavor this is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that wont keep you up because of the caffeinebr br each sealed package holds ten ounces of extrafine ground coffee the bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packagingbr br with coffee prices going up it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this if you try this and like it you get a better price with the amazon subscribe  save option versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you
4529,5,disclaimer im a coffee addict  im also a starbucks addict so ive become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and cant stand the economy stuff  ive had regular melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it so i decided to give the decaf version a try especially when the weather gets cold i like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and dont particular want to be tossing and turning hours laterbr br the riviera sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you dont want the real thing it had a nice rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste  while i continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions im glad to know theres a good flavorful substitute for when i dont want caffeine
4530,5,smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee  i usually dont have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but i now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor
4531,5,boy  this was good the aroma when you first open the package leaves one with great anticipation that you will soon be enjoying a great cup of java too often times  the result does not meet the expectations not so with the melitta cafe collection  the coffee was amongst the best i have ever tasted treat yourself to a fantastic splurge 
4532,4,i am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffeei figure whats the point  taste is so often compromised  i have recently found that caffeine bothers me if i drink it after pm so its decaff or nothing at that point  riviera sunrise tastes like regular coffee  i was so impressed i decided to try it as my morning coffee  i expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen  if you must give up caffeine this is a great solution
4533,5,ive decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor with this product i wont have to do that anymore the flavor of this coffee is exceptional its as full and rich as any off the shelf coffee ive ever tasted highly recommended
4534,4,this melitta riviera sunset blend is a nice and light coffee that is suitable for anytime of day  its particularly great for drinking at night because it is decaffeinated  the texture is nice and does not have an acidic taste or anything  its meant for casual drinkers  i do prefer my coffee darker with caffine but i did enjoy this blend  i would recommend giving this a try and judge for yourself
4535,4,this coffee was deep and rich and did not have a bitter taste too it  i did have to use a little more than what was recommended to get it the way i drink coffee but coffee is a personal thing everyone has their desired strength  the coffee was fresh upon opening but began to go down hill really quick as far as aroma and taste goes so invest in a good air tight container  i liked this coffee but it i could go on in the morning if i did not have it
4536,4,we dont drink much coffee and less decaf but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit everybody has been pleased with the melitta nobody has complained about the taste and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they werent just being politely quiet we got the first sample free through the vine program but i would buy it in the future
4537,3,im not sure what all the fuss is about  i thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand i usually  buy  and beings the store brand is much cheaper ill stick with it  it isnt bad coffee but i just dont seeing it being any better
4538,3,this makes a good pot of decaf  nothing remarkable  we have served this to many guests to no comments  nobody asked us what it was but nobody spit it out either   it is smooth and not too strong which is our preference  we wouldnt hesitate to buy it again but wouldnt go out of our way either
4539,5,melitta cafe is a smooth flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee  this is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many american brands  melitta has a rich deep taste and a nice dark color  tastes great black or with cream  as a stand alone coffee no creamsugar it has a smooth though strong flavor just like regular coffee  this coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink  strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later  great coffee
4540,4,this product had a good nice scent and strong taste not too unique compared to a lot of over the counter canned decaffs already available but overall its a good after dinner type of coffee to serve guestsbr br price wise its reasonable but there are many other comparable products that may have a more distinguished taste overall its a good product and worth trying for decaff drinkers
4541,5,this coffee has a nice flavor not too bitter just a nice round coffee taste rich flavor naturally decaffeinated with water and its kosher whats not to love
4542,4,ive blended this with a darker fullcaf melitta coffee and love the resultsbr br the fine grinding is a tad small for the french press i use but the taste is wonderfulbr br i was a little concerned at the darkness variation in the two when i decided to blend but the outcome was finebr br the only real complaint i have is the packaging cheap glue on the metal folddown part causes it to fall off true for both bags i received so dont rely on thatbr br otherwise a delicious coffee that is mellow in taste the way i choose to prepare it
4543,5,this is an excellent coffee rich and full of flavor not watery  many decafs are obviously decaf  this one tastes great with a medium body  the grind is fine which works great in our drip coffee maker  it also has a nice aroma and no bitter aftertaste  it doesnt have the burnt flavor that a certain large coffeehouse chain has which personally i dont care for  i found it closer to einsteins house blend but much betterbr br this is a great quality coffee highly recommended  i will be buying more
4544,5,im a big coffee drinker and this melitta cafe offering is rich with no bitterness sometimes decaf coffee has a funny oily aftertaste but this coffee had none of that unpleasantness highly recommended
4545,3,the coffee is good but it is nothing special compared to maxwelhouse decafe this is nearly the same just slightly better i dont feel it is worth the extra cash to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere i did enjoy the coffee but i probably wont buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted
4546,3,first of all when i opened my bag of melitta decaf it didnt have that strong amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has  i brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker and while it was ok there was nothing outstanding about the taste  it was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee i normally drink
4547,4,i have a keurig coffee maker you know the one with the kcups  to have a coffee like this you have to have a special filter which i do have  honestly youll spend a crapload of money on kcups if you dont get the filter for regular ground coffee  anyway i dont know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way but the water in my keurig had a hard time seeping through causing a bit of an overflow  aside from that the taste was smooth and flavorful  it has a coffee taste plain and simple  is it anything special not really  it just tastes good and is reasonably priced
4548,4,i have been enjoying the melitta coffee in the evening it has a nice smooth taste with none of the burnt coffee bean taste of starbucks i used much more coffee than suggested in preparation though i used  tablespoons to eight ounces of water i like my coffee strong but not bitter and this worked for a very good cup of coffee with half and half addedi will be buying it again
4549,5,very smooth and i used my own filters the smell is so inviting i used my own measurements because it was not on the package  i used l tblsp per cup and i worked out fine for me i like my coffee tasteful
4550,4,if melitta doesnt sell good coffee who does  i grew up using melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter generally i use pre ground coffee so i am not a purist although i occasionally grind my own  i usually drink two cups of coffee a day  enough about my coffee habitsbr br melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry and i expected this coffee to be be a quality product  i was not disappointed with the coffee although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee i recently tried from melitta  the flavor was pretty strong and rich although decaf always has a slight aftertaste even with the swiss water process used for decaffeinating  generally i drink regular coffee as my first choice but i admit that i switch to decaf in the eveningbr br i have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice
4551,4,i do not like decaf coffee  i think it has an aftertaste  but i thought i would give this a try  it truly surprised me  there is a mellow full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found  i will definitely buy it again to reduce the caffein in our household
4552,4,im not a huge fan of coffees from the americas i generally find them a bit light for my taste im a big fan of sumatra and other pacificgrown coffees  but riviera sunset is a nice light coffee smooth and not terribly acid  its a pleasant coffee for people who like their brews with more brightness and less bodybr br im also frankly not nuts about decaf but that aspect doesnt intrude too much on the flavor here
4553,5,i am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee as a result of this habit i find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes as a general rule i prefer an arabica bean but i could not find a reference to bean type on the bag curious i checked their web site and found they use the arabica bean exclusivelybr br on the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the rivera sunset coffee the swiss water process is used their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the watersoluble caffeine present in the beans as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water the water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water this decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee finally the coffee is dried and ready for roastingbr br more information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process i found the web site to be user friendly and well thought outbr br another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee ive found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffeebr br let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself first it is very smooth and rich i almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice that is very rare the coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which i found pleasingbr br i did face one challenge with this coffee the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it after working on it for several minutes i had decided i was not going to let a bag beat me i discovered that i was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back once i got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy fortunately the two small tears i made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed the bag recommends storage in a refrigeratorbr br this coffee is pleasant and refreshing and i have enjoyed drinking it if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think i hope youre as pleased with it as i am
4554,5,ok i have to admit i was a huge sb fan you know that big stellarmoney coffee chain on every corner i didnt expect much from a coffee ordered online but i take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth rich coffee there is none of the gritty acidic after taste of other coffees but instead a blooming silky flavor of nuts mocha and pure coffee mind you this isnt a flavored coffee it has all of these nuances built into the riviera sunset decaf blend oh did i forget to mention its decaf i couldnt believe it myself when i looked at the bag the second day i thought it was true caffinated coffee by the flavor alone though i did notice the lack of energizing as would any decaf highly recommended and i am switching
4555,4,this coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work yet it goes down smoothly to my wife and i thats a good combination the fact that it comes already ground doesnt do anything to subtract the flavor either
4556,5,im far more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker but i cant start the day without a cup or three of coffee plus im not really awake until i smell the coffee brewing  just not morning without itbr br i tend to buy more affordable eg supermarket type brands of coffee so i can splurge on tea so this was a real treat  outstanding aroma just opening the bag and even better when brewing delightfully smooth taste and highly drinkable black the only way i drink coffee or teabr br my only complaint is opening the bag based on what other reviewers stated i opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills very glad i did  an appreciable amount was spilled when i cut into the bag i decanted it into an airtight container ive had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee but the very fine grind of the melitta made it even more of a problembr br still not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star this makes a wonderful cup of coffee
4557,4,ive tried to give up my coffee habit but it just hasnt been easy  dh and i did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago so i suppose thats something  im a moderate coffee drinker i like  cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning and love a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon  this melitta riviera sunset decaf is smooth and doesnt have the bitter aftertaste that i dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands  the flavor is great and ive enjoyed it both hot and iced
4558,4,what can you say about coffee either you like it or you dont i liked this coffee although when i choose to review it i didnt notice it was decaf that aside it tastes fine made in my keurig but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one
4559,5,the coffee is excellent with a smooth taste and pleasant aroma  it did not have that bitterplastic  aftertaste you find in a lot of decaf coffeesbr br the grind is very fine  my cheapo coffee filters let a little bit of the coffee through  use good quality filters with this coffeebr br it was difficult to open the package and the little wire closer fell off after the second time  however i understand why coffee is packages this way to minimize the exposure of the oils in the coffee to air and of course a fine grind has a larger surface to mass ratio making it age even faster  so i forgive them for the packaging  you really need an airtight opaque container to store this kind of coffeebr br personally i like to grind my coffee right before using but the convenience and taste of this melitta  has convinced me that there are other options
4560,4,first lets talk about the packaging  i hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this  theyre quite cumbersome and in my opinion do not keep the coffee fresh enoughbr br as for the coffee itself this was one of the better tasting decafs i have had  it has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee  it has a wonderful aroma as well  very pleased with this product
4561,4,when it comes down to melitta they definitely have known for all this time what it takes to really made a great cup of coffee with their cafe collection they definitelly bring out the best in flavors for all kinds of coffee lovers and that is really a strong aroma with their rivera sunset they definitely bring out a decaffinated taste that feels like it is full of pep at the beginning of the morning i really love it the taste is strong and the intimate aroma is just delightful all in all i absolutely recommend this as a great treat in the morning to wake up and enjoybr br price bbr br taste bbr br overall b 
4562,5,this coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing  my husband drinks a lot more coffee than i do and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee  we are looking forward to trying melittas other varieties
4563,5,i am not much of a coffee drinker mainly because i do not drink caffeine and because i have never acquired the taste for coffee however i was tempted to try this product and i was really surprised by how good it tasted  it did not have any of the bitter after taste and more importantly i could not tell that it was decaffeinated  this is important because most decaf coffees have an odd taste to me but that oddness was missing from this productbr br furthermore i had to ask a coffee lover for an opinion so i asked my motherinlaw who drinks all kinds of coffees from all over the world almost  times a day  she was skeptical at first because she refuses to drink decaf  however after a few sips of this coffee she said that although it is a mild coffee it was in fact very tasty and nothing hinted at its decaf origins  she liked it so much she poured another cupbr br between the two of us we have almost finished the bag  it should pass the test from even the pickiest coffee drinkers  i positively recommend this product and i hope you enjoy your next cup of coffee from this company
4564,4,i prepared this coffee in a french press although it is ground too fine for this  it had a nice aroma a full taste and mild bitterness  its a fools game to try to describe the taste of anything in any detail so ill just leave you with the coffee was quite good and it would make a good after dinner coffeebr br my only complaint is the coffee is preground  ground coffee is a bit stale by the time you get it however a blade grinder will ruin the coffee as wellbr br if you dont own a burrgrinder this is the best cup of decaff youre going to get
4565,5,this is the best decaf my family and i have tried in a long time its smooth not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands ive tried i like that its decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals thats a big plus for me because many brands dont tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee i usually buy whole bean but this ground is so nice and fine and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right id suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor this is one ill be buying again
4566,5,this review is from my wifebr br im not one who has all the right words for describing taste and flavor unfortunately  i say unfortunately because this is a very good tasting coffee and it deserves elegant description  what i can tell you is that it has no edgy bitterness  no bitterness at all actually  its rich and smooth  yumbr br i use a european coffee press for brewing and this grind worked beautifully in that  not too course not small enough to make a mess through the screen
4567,5,at last a decaf coffee that doesnt taste decaf  smooth rich flavorful with no bitter aftertaste  starbucks worthy but to my husband who doesnt care for starbucks its way better  we like to drink this in the evening and its basically dessert with cream and sugar
4568,5,melittas cafe collection gourmet coffee is wonderful it tastes rich and just like a gourmet coffee should  this coffee tasted like something i could have gotten in europe at a cafebr br it brewed very quickly and with no coffee grain residue  this is probably due to the coffee being an extra fine grind the decaffinated version tasted great on its own without milk or sugar to seasonbr br im a coffee lover and i enjoy gevalia and godiva coffeetwo other excellent foregn brands  the melitta stands on its own and are their equivalents in taste and price enjoy a cup today
4569,5,soon as i got this bag of decaf i made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh brewed coffee  it is very finely ground but i still used the same amount i normally do and it turned out great  i added some soy milk sat back and enjoyed my rare treat of an afternoon coffee break  definitely will buy some of this for the winter months so i can treat myself to excellent hot coffee any time of the day or night
4570,4,i often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side not in this product  the coffee had a strong grip but not bitter and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used note this coffee works well with a soy creamer  you do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a decaf option  with such a strong grip i would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is
4571,3,the aroma of a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtmvemelitta cafe collection riviera sunset decaffeinated ground coffee ounce bagsa was fairly weak scent after all is a huge part of taste and this was disappointingbr br even though i added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed i found the coffee to be a bit bland the taste was more than flavored water but not amazingly so with no subtle overtones it wasnt bitter but it wasnt much of anythingbr br while i generally drink hitest as opposed to decaffeinated i do drink decaf at least twice a week the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtmvemelittaa was comparable to the generic brand that i usually havebr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtmvemelitta cafe collection riviera sunset decafa isnt a bad coffee but its not worth the money if there are other options available
4572,5,i am in no way any coffee expert connoisseur or heavy user to be perfectly honest i had to look up how to spell connoisseur but having a heart attack  months ago i am learning to never use caffeine salt or almost any darn thing i love and i hate anything that is light decaf or artificially sweetened my wife has bought about every single brand of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted real decaf to try in her drip coffee maker hated em all just hated them saw this so thought i would try the latest brand i would hate since it wouldnt cost me anythingbr br  first batch was way to bitter for me didnt even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker from that next batch on i became hooked on this brand i dont like the price but love the taste  that conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a  star overall if i tinker with taste as i also add assorted coffeemate creamers also something i am not allowed anymore but refuse to give up the taste goes to a  for me even with all the discounts if i order through the subscribe  save program see below i find this a bit priceybr br br br update december  br   it still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very st vine program item i ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me as a result i raise my review from  stars to  starts another thing i like is i have no decaf aftertaste that i always experience with other brands it is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing for me anyway that i can still really enjoy that helps me relax in the middle of all this cant eat this cant drink that stuff going on in my life the past  months its also the time i havent felt like i was compromising good taste for good health for that i am truly grateful just ordered the  pack on the amazon subscribe  save page
4573,3,decaffeinated coffee is for most an oxymoron for others an afterthought it possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the gourmet coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives comedian bob irwin even compared the blend to kissing your sister the days first cup comes with a sense of entitlement subsequent cups transition through the day work afternoon dessert while wanting both coffees jolt and cozy sociability instant dont get me startedbr thats why this new melitta riviera sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise it carries a full almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which for many defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle this isnt surprising since melittas ad copy references the breezy feel of european cafes a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shopbr no less than henry ward beecher once said no coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils  riviera sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesnt disappoint when pouredhold to the preparation instructions yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic its taste not its caffeine jolt is your wakeup call recommended as a tastier if somwhat pricier alternative to major brands
4574,2,some reviewers say the coffee is bitter i like bitter but i didnt like this it wasnt a good bitter taste it was a cringe kind of tastebr br i drink one of the strongest coffees out there and this was too much for me the strange taste of it turned me offbr i once owned a coffee pot by melitta too and it took a cone shaped special filter i wasnt impressed with that eitherbr br maybe im just not big on arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me not smooth bitter yes but not smoothbr br it smells ok i agree with charlie  another amazon reviewer who said the package was difficult to open it was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open the bag tore apartbr br no way would i spend  bucks for this if i was addicted to it possibly but even then thats steep and i surely wont buy this in the futurebr br you can go down to the local name of popular coffee shop here and get  bags for this price of freshly ground coffeebr br melitta makes it sound like its the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package gourmet swiss water process from europes charming sidewalk cafes top quality hand picked beansbr br if you want to pay this kind of money and like melitta coffee then get it but i dont think its anything special
4575,3,im not a coffee snob  i can tell that there is a difference between kenyan and columbian but i cant tell you which is which without a label  this decaf tastes good  i like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream the coffee flavor isnt subdued by these additions  the bag ultimately required scissors to open  the blurb for this says pack of  i only got one bag  not sure why that is its happened before with other products  would i buy this again  sure if it was on sale    thats how i buy my coffee most of the time
4576,3,first off i received a bag of this coffee via the vine program to review at no cost  secondly i am more of a bold slapmeintheface french roast coffee drinker or starbucks gold coast so i had my reservations about this decafbr br and  well for me this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package an ok flavor once brewed sort of a nutty strange flavor at first and once consumed left an aftertaste in my mouthbr br it is definitely a different roast than i am used to but it is decent for a preground melita decaf  more of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion  overall  not too badbr br i give this coffee a soso recommendation
4577,4,i remember the cool modern melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago a visual delight of glass and wood without a hint of plastic they were elegantly ahead of their time i wish i could say the same for their coffee its fine coffee good actually however nothing really special i would buy it again if priced right but probably would not go out of my way to get it and certainly not at a gourmet price point i must be honest and say that with the melitta name i expected a little bit more maybe i just got a an off batch lets hope so
4578,4,on an untypically cool august evening we decided to try melitta riviera sunset decaf i heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter overly heavy cup  i know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste we like it strong but not that  much on our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semisweet cup of decaf it was pleasing those who love strong robust fullbodied taste ought to definitely buy melitta brand coffees
4579,3,i usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week more as an indulgence than as a necessity  its a sipping beverage for me and flavor matters a lot  that said i add milk and sugar so im not excessively picky or i think so at least  so im always glad to find new gourmet blends to add to my list of favoritesbr br this blend seemed promising with a very nice aroma and a perfect even grind  i usually grind my own beans but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine asis  it even produced a rich smooth crema  unfortunately my first sip  without sugar or milk  was very bitter  i ended up adding about a halfteaspoon more sugar than i usually use just to compensate  even then the coffee flavor itself was thin and weak  with just a little milk added it tasted more like well flavored milkbr br this coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago  fine for that application but not really what im looking for in rich smooth flavor with low bitterness
4580,3,this coffee tastes better than folgers thats not much of an endorsement but since folgers is about all i ever drink its my only point of comparison i would recommend you dont try the stupid and counterproductive experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some saturday morning as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three overthecounter painkillers to get rid of and in the meantime while youre trying to fight off the headache youll be completely unable to make headway with that craptastic novel you just got from amazon which was reinforcing all your worst opinions of the romantic fantasy subgenre before you had to lie down and commence clutching your forehead
4581,5,if you like to have a cup of coffee after dinner with desert then this is perfect  i love it especially for the fact that i dont feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing  nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and fuzzy after a wonderful dinnerbr br i have tried many different coffees and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffees  melitta is a great brand and well worth the money  i also use this to make lattes and its great  its a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java  you get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny
4582,3,normally i would not purchase coffee online as i have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance  i saw this and figured why notbr br this coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where i had to use scissors to open it  one thing i tend to avoid is preground coffee  i usually like to grind my own beans as i find the taste is betterbr br the smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic  usually there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something  there wasnt anything distinct about this coffeebr br i used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but i suspect it would not matter as i was surprised that there really isnt a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which i drank blackbr br the taste was kind of bland  i did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to helpbr br overall its an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado  however its not something i would add to my list of brands i purchase
4583,4,riviera sunset decaffinated coffee from the melitta cafeacute collection is a good coffee for that first morning cup of coffee  it is a south american blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of javabr br the coffee comes in an attractive  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve  the folks at melitta know how to compact coffee for travelall ambient air was sucked out of the bag shrinking the usual size of the  ounces from its expected size to a small dense brick  cutting open the bag there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size  the aroma was intoxicatingthink deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it  the bag does not indicate the level of the roast but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast somewhere between a full city and european  the bag states that this is an extra fine grind but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than youd want for fine espresso and is more of a fine grind  this i imagine is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machinebr br for some reason the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water  im not sure how they drink coffee in europe but in the us coffee machines measure by the cup  this leads to a bizarre  teaspoons of coffee per cup and to my taste a slightly weak cup of coffee  in spite of the grind id stick with the usual  tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there  your intuition should serve you well and id stick with your usual measurements im one of those heaping tablespoon per cup guysbr br the coffee definitely shows its south american origins  in spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma the coffee once  brewed is more light breakfasty and slightly more acidic than i imagined it would be given the type of coffee that it is it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast still it is a well balanced south american blend  it lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded less biting flavor  although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive tastebr br this is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark earthy and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own  this coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffera fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those torani syrups eg a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeeqstorani syrup vanilla ounce bottles pack of a for a little extra flavor for those who like those kind of things  it also makes a great iced coffee  if cold brewed the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet but also loses a little personality in the process i did not try using this in an espresso machine as i do not have one but i dont think that it would yield a great espresso  concentrated i think the acidity might become overwhelmingbr br all in all this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price  with a little experimentation on the proportions it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee
4584,4,this coffee had two strikes against it it was decaf and it was already ground i do use decaf generally in a  mix with full strength caffeinated coffee but i always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness still i thought id give this melitta coffee a shot it was free from vines after all im happy to say it surpassed expectations i made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black as i always do its surprisingly drinkable if a little on the light side still the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey though i do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides theres really not much aftertaste at all truth be told its as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee ive ever had and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesnt seem to be an issue here ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean so id suggest using it fairly quickly but thats easy to do with a ounce bag if youre a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans id highly recommend this brand
4585,2,the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent though subtle unfortunately it quickly dissipated  i really couldnt smell anything after a minute which i assume is due to it being pregroundbr br i brewed this coffee in a french press as well as in a drip brewer both results tasted flat and boring although there was a decent amount of body  at least it was inoffensive perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee for about the same price you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store
4586,3,i am amazed at the consistent flavor of melitta coffees seriously i sip any melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same not bad coffee always a darker roast and a deep flavor but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package the riviera sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee perfect for an after dinner treat
4587,3,melitta cafes riviera sunset coffee isnt bad it just sadly isnt all that great either  it is not something i would buy again mainly because ill probably forget about it
4588,4,i have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee i drink  cups a day maybe so i am mixing  melitta colombian and  decaf i substituted this for the other decaf i have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has the price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well i dont care for the packaging however i couldnt get it open without cutting the top and then i had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it with all the mess that that entails if it were in a can i would be more inclined to buy it but the taste for a decaf is quite good
4589,5,im surprised how much it tastes like coffee to be completely accurate it tastes like a watered down coffee like the kind you get at hotels with hazelnut flavor  and a very slight earthy undertone if someone gave me a sip and didnt tell me what it was id think it were coffee lets put it that waybr br theres not all that much root per teabag though and since i like strong coffee i only use  oz of water per bag and steep it covered for  mins then with some cream and sugar its quite goodbr br as for the liver tonic claim well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver i dont know about that yet but so far i havent noticed any ill effects from drinking this i feel fine if not outright good after drinking a cup but thats as far as i can confirm the effectsbr br and with even decaf coffee containing  mg caffeine per serving this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine anyone who needs a coffee substitute do give this a try
4590,2,ive read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as coffee tasting or with roasted flavors but to be very truthful it tastes just the way i could imagine second hand smoke would its very very strong requires  minutes to steep and is not for the faint hearted ive heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product but i was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits good luck to those who care to brave this roasted flavor
4591,4,i have been taking this tea twice per day and i am enjoying the way i feel
4592,3,this is part of dr ozs tea diet works like a charm i have lost inches already and i have been on it for  days
4593,1,this was the worst tasting tea actually the worst tasting anything that i have ever consumed i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup it tasted like dirt which makes sense since it is a root the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash
4594,4,hands down by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had and i have allot i am an avid tea drinker and i just cant get it down the benefits are supposed to be amazing so ill keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow its bad so strong too tastes like dirt thats been pissed on in the woods
4595,5,dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure which is why i drink it  ive pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute though one must acquire a taste for it  at home i use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel
4596,4,i really like this tea i started drinking it at the suggestion of a friendbr it helps to sooth an upset stomache i will be buying it again in the future
4597,5,i love this brand of dandelion root tea  the tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular  transaction went smooth like always  so glad to hear amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door  i have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but i do a lot of it on amazoncom
4598,5,i love this tea and it makes you feel very healthy which is so needed during the christmas and new year season i havent used it in one week and i can soooo feel my body needing a good detox  i recommend for anyone who has stomach issues over indulges and wants to feel generally better
4599,5,reveived my item fast it was exactly what i ordered in excellent shape with safe shipping  i will came back and shop here again  thanks
4600,5,i drink this tea every day im  months pregnant and have done so since i found out i was pregnant  i love that its organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy  i dont notice anything dramatic when i drink it or dont drink it but i will say i feel nourished when i drink it and have had no pregnancy complications whatsoever  im  this is my first pregnancy and i have been exceptionally healthy throughout  i highly recommend this for any pregnant womanat least a cup a day
4601,4,as an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth i have had hundreds of teas and everything from this company as well i read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad what do i care id rather be healthy i never take sugar in my tea either if youve read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was you cant imagine how bad it is without exaggeration i would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt yes as a  year old with children i know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink my recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea as you know the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes yea dont do that with this four stars because it is apparently very good for you and i thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better
4602,5,i was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than i expected ginger flavor in this product  it is excellent if you like ginger try this  best on hot biscuits  update  ive just reordered wish they sold it by the gallon its different something you cant find locally and excellent
4603,2,first let me state that i brew most of my tea in a gaiwan hence i use loose leaf teabr br white tea is one of my favorites so im always on the lookout for a nicely priced bai mudanbr br as much as i love bai hao yinzhen i just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea i drinkbr br i thought this was a pretty good price and when i opened it up it didnt look too bad either  much to my surprise after taking the first layer off the top i transfer my tea to good tea tins it was nearly all powderdust with hardly any intact leaves  this is extremely problematic if you dont use any filters or screens like me  i dont mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you dont pour through a screen however this was so broken up that it was just unworkablebr br i have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point i most likely wont be ordering it againbr br that being said the whole leaves that were there on the top looked fine  it does have a bit of a green tea taste vs some other high quality white tea i am used to however it isnt bad or anything  definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasnt mostly powderbr br i took a couple pics so i will post themkeep in mind this came in two pouches i poured into tins and that is where i took the pictures the product does not actually come in tins
4604,5,i love this tea  both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh  i have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites  i didnt realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until i had this brand  for organic tea it is quite reasonably priced  they recommend using two tsp of loose tea per cup  i use half that and it tastes great  never ever bitter  very smooth tasting  i highly recommend
4605,5,was glad to find this procuct on line as it is not sold in stores around here  found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try  sure glad i did  i researched this company and they have been in business since  this is the only preanut butter i really like it is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better  it doesnt need to add anything  great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable
4606,5,this was a great mothers day gift the packaging is unique very artful and well designed inside are different pouches for each of the winearita flavors the box is substantial  it feels great wrapped up in wrapping paper also the winearita people had the foresight to put two different types of recipes on the box one for wine and one for hard alcohol brilliant move in my opinion my mom is not the biggest liquor drinker so now she can make iced drinks with wine as the base rather than hard alcohol though other reviews state that they only received the drink pouches in a plastic bag this was not the case for my purchase i will update this review if we tinker with the recipes
4607,5,this is definitely a girls alcoholic slushy  there are  different flavors and you can use any wine you choose the package directions are for an entire blender of slush i have found that using a tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person  good stuff  have not found anyone who does not like this product
4608,5,i have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious they are great for parties and entertaining
4609,5,this review is for the packaging and not the actual mix since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and some wrote about how poor the packaging was all i can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags there are more than enough instructions to go by
4610,5,i had tried these at a friends house and loved them but could not find them anywhere i shop they are very good for parties or a weekend treat for you and the girls
4611,4,i bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor one on each side it makes a cute little colorful box nice to give as a gift if you put it together
4612,1,i also bought two of these as gifts and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others  unacceptable packaging  unless you have already tried the product there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it  i assumed big mistake that there would be some kind of packaging but there was not  this is really sad too because the product is great
4613,2,i purchased this as a present but it doesnt come as shown in the picture  it is little white bags with the flavor written on them  someone receiving it as a gift wouldnt even know what it was unless i explained it to them will be returning
4614,2,i bought this for a christmas gift but i will be returning there is no box or packaging as pictured it is just  white baggies containing the mixes which would be fine if i was just buying for myself but not for a gift
4615,4,id rate these as better than average but since i am not a fan of flavored coffees id only give them a  rating as to me they taste artificial and weird like all flavored coffees do the regular coffees were very good better than many i really liked the amazonia and the africana medium roasts not so much the colombian the dark roast eclipse mexican and french roast were very good i made them into ice coffee strong but not bitter i didnt care for the costa rican light roast it had an artificial taste to me the house blend was good but nothing to write home about i hate decaf so i used that kcup to water my plants with so as far as taste goes i have no idea but my plants perked up the chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious if priced right id buy them again
4616,3,i ordered in order to get variety of flavored coffees and have to admit disappointed in the selection several duplicates of ordinary coffees received also  of the flavors advertised which were my primary reason for ordering were not included
4617,5,product was timely delivered as advertised  there is a wonderful selection of coffees which my clients and i are currently enjoying  will order again
4618,3,i was very excited to recieve my shipment today then to be disapppointed because  of the flavors that i was told would be in the package were not there i really wanted to try creme brulee and raspberry chocolate truffle  i am looking forward to trying the others but had i know i would not receive these flavors i would not have ordered this product  i also did not recieve the pink ribbon flavor
4619,5,love van houtte k cups the selections provided allow one to sample coffees from different regions as well as taste the flavored coffees without having to buy a complete box of each  then you can pick the ones you like  buy that particular coffeegreat concept
4620,5,this is very good coffee i have been purchaseing this coffee for a long time an as long as amazon carys tiis i will keep buy it i like the tast it has a nice chocolate tast to it
4621,5,i love the subcription option at amazon and am using it to get this smooth and nonbitter coffee i love it
4622,4,i got this at a local discount store for  it has an excellent flavor and the only reason i gave it  stars instead if  was personal preference
4623,5,my first package came damaged but the first rate customer service department replaced it quickly the orzo are delicious and easy to cook
4624,5,ive used this product in traditional risotto recipes but its also excellent to use in things like chicken soup makes a nice creamy thick soup base  im still exploring other ways to use this wonderful product
4625,4,im not sure why no one seems to like these very much  they are pretty good to us  i havent had a problem with them falling apart and theyre easy to slice for toasting  my sonwho is the one on the gfcf diet is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new ate these muffins without hesitating i sometimes poke a hole in the middle and serve as a bagel  these are a regular staple in our house
4626,4,if you need gluten free nondairy and no egg pickings are pretty slimbr br if you use a really sharp serrated knife and work carefully you can split them successfullybr br great for minipizzas
4627,4,these are ok i like the sweet potato ones better and both have good fiber content
4628,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbffrygenerg foods english muffins ounce units pack of abr br these are one of my favorite gluten free items and a regular item to keep on hand  i take for lunch and toast and very filling and easy but cheaper than going to fast food places  i use for mini pizzas hamburg buns bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast chicken sandwiches etc  easy to take on trips or friends and family to eat must toast or bake for best favor
4629,5,how can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than  per unit when they can run as high as  per unit retail
4630,5,these are great we were told to stay away from wheat barley and rye this is a good answer for us they a not precut so you have to cut them in to i recommend them
4631,3,pkg says soy free ingredients and my stomachbladder say otherwisebr also lots of fiber in this one if you can handle fiber and soy this food will fill you up like crazy if you have ibs and have trouble with fiberor are eating a low residue diet be carefulbr im going back to the bread eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the dreaded wheat
4632,5,this product is very good but i have this feeling that it is rather highly priced i dont know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredientspeople with gluten problem are not just eating healthy but are sick and should not be exploited i like the muffins particularly when they are toasted
4633,4,tried this item liked it this item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting  around here driving  miles one way is local  ps  these can make great mini pizzas
4634,1,the energ english muffins that i received from amazon were not of the same quality when i buy them directly from the distributor in seattle  they crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible  also there were only  in the pack instead of  i had to cancel my recurring order
4635,1,the energ foods english muffins look good in the packaging but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom  this presents a gooy feel in the mouth and both my husband and i got stomach aches  wont be buying this again
4636,2,these english muffins are okay at best  they are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast  they definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise do not taste the best
4637,1,if you are looking for  english muffins  go to the grocery store and buy them  these do not even resemble english muffins and are tasteless  however if you are on a restricted diet wheat flour soy dairy glutenetc these might be for you  check the list of ingredients  i didnt care for them at all
4638,2,i tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll i couldnt cut them without falling apart  i ended up toasting them in pieces more like chunks and with enough cream cheese they were only ok  tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products i would recommend
4639,1,these are not the greatest  thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come  not so  they were not what i had expected
4640,2,come on amazon give me a break  powdered tofu  get in some real food and ill buy more from you i went looking for table sugar youve got  weird kinds of sugar that you expect me to buy in bulk but no just plain sugar im not eatin any more of this rice and tofu bread eitherbr br sorry i just had to rant
4641,5,dried berries still with texture and the quintessential aroma pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture but in ten years trying to find them  gee so now i know to look for it on amazon
4642,5,again exactly what i ordered no fuss no muss arrived on time pretty much an ideal transaction only thing that threw me was that i underestimated the quantity gallon baggie in the freezer ftw
4643,3,berries are find but the package is bad unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor
4644,3,ive been sampling as many sugarfree chocolates as i can find  this one was okay but not the best  i dont think what i got was the freshest either as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar  the best ive found so far is cavalier brand at another website
4645,4,shipping was really goodand i got what i ordered on time will buy from againalittle pricy but my little dog likes them
4646,1,do not buy  review online  looks like another treat made in china with multiple reports of suspected poisoning  please only buy treats made in the usa
4647,5,thanks to amazon for carrying this wonderful product  my local grocery store no longer carries this product and generally promotes thier private label house brands br for those folks whom enjoy fettuccine alfredo  this product cant be beat br it is fast and very easy to prepare and a excellent italian pasta dinner can be ready in  minutes or less br for me  i do add some extra parm cheese to the mix  yet  that is personal preference br we really enjoy tossing in some boneless and skinless chicken  grilled  to add to the sauce and create our ownchicken alfredo br thanks again to amazon and to mc cormicks for making this product availalbe br br chuck runzo  pittsburgh  pa 
4648,4,i love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make onesaw this while at the grocery earlier decided to try it followed the instructions and viola one awesome dinner note i did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor
4649,4,i went searching for charcoal dog biscuits after reading that they help with digestive gas and bad breath  this appears to be only one of two brands on the market  i havent tried the other one i think its called sportmix because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs  my dog has been eating one a day and i cant say for sure whether or not they work she used to have really smell gas she hasnt dropped a bomber like that in a while so maybe its due to the biscuits  who knows  she does like these biscuits very much so i will surely buy them again
4650,4,my yo cardigan welsh corgi loves these things and when they stopped carrying them at petsmart i had to go here for them  they seem to be made of good ingredients and theyre the right size for him  plus he loves them and thats whats important
4651,5,i have a  year old scottish terrier who has some food allergies no wheat for my girl  this treat is great for settleing an upset stomach and my dog looks forward to her charcoal bone treats
4652,4,my dog loved these and i think they probably helped with his gas and dare i say his breath too
4653,5,everyone here whos tried exclusive energy has been surprised by its unique ability to pleasantly refreshbr hope it will become more readily available
4654,5,love the products both the sugar free and the regular are great feel refreshed absolutely no crash no after taste stopped drinking monster and full throttle and started drinking exclusive
4655,5,most of the time you want crackers because you want to get the dip or whatever topping into your mouth with these you can have those snacks again without having to worry about the calorie content of your crackersbr br theyre only  calories a slice and each slice is about the size of a  x  notecard theyre delicate and have a nice easy crunch these ones in particular have a lower sodium content as well versus the pesto and garlic ones theyre a bit higher in sodium content over  mg per  slicesbr br its an excellent addition no matter what diet you are onor if youre not even on a diet i bring them to parties and everyone always asks what they are and where can they get them
4656,5,i highly recommend these very tasty kavli thin crispbreads i wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches i hate whole wheat i love rye i saw these noticed the ingredients couldnt get much simpler and gave them a try topped with cheese or a sandwich spread or whatever youd like theyre very tasty i feel as full after  or  of these topped of course as i did with just white bread theyre nice and thin so it isnt like biting into anything hard  just a nice crunch the flavor isnt strong at all  it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past then i noticed that they are only  calories per slice whats not to love they taste good theyre whole grain theyre super low in calories its no crunchier than a potato chip and i feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them oh  and they keep forever in the cupboard i definitely will be buying these for a long time 
4657,4,great alternative for those who cant eat wheat a little bland but crunchy and crispy
4658,5,as someone who suffers occasionally from digestive difficulties these kavli crispy thins are among the few things that i can eat at such times  i always keep these crackers around to add to soups  however there are also times when they are the only thing i can properly digest  this is a great item to have around when having digestive difficulties associated with the flu or stress  for me they work better than the bananas rice applesauce or toast of the brat diet used in relieving ibs these thin easy to chew crackers are a really great product
4659,5,based on other reviews i tried these kavli products  theyre great lowfat snacks  these are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between br br recommended
4660,5,kavli crispy thin crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses  the taste is fantastic  its fresh and pleasant to eat  kavli products are the best
4661,5,my wife is on the low carb diet well we are on the low carb diet  which means small breakfast if you do not have time to make eggs and bacon it is hard to get the coffee down without peanut butter she says we have been using crackers like these kavli crispbreads to get down the peanut butter since before i can remember  i think it was when dan and mary eads published protien power plan in the late s many years ago we found these to be the best we could only find them in wegmans grocery store in ne pennsylvania and now that the army has moved us again to fort knox ky we can only find them at kroger recently we cannot seem to find them there either so we order them they come fast not broken and they are fresh also they are not any more costly to purchase online and pay for delivery than to waste time looking for them one note my wife hates opnening things and we found the best way to do so with these is to cut off the end of the cellophane with scissors  prevents cracks of this thin bread
4662,5,i enjoy my kavli crispy thins so much and so often that i now order by the case besides being naturally low fat and naturally nutritious kavli crisp thins are a great replacement for salty fattening nachoes and or pizza with crispy thins you can make your own nachos by layering the crisps w chopped tomatoes cheese even ground meat  pop  crisp thins w toppings in microwave and  youve got your delicious nachos or pizza i have crispy thins w melted cheese every morning  great way to start the day no i dont work for kavli  this is not an ad but a truthful review also so nice and easy to be able to order kavli  and just about everything via amazon
4663,5,my wife like these better that the swedish version wasa as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product  we will buy again
4664,4,wheatfree natural ingredients easy to chew dry by itself but is good with coconut oil andor fruit spread
4665,5,i havent seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here although  boxes is a lot theyre great with butter and honey havent tried them with anything elsebr theyre very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out  but they still have a healthy taste
4666,4,this crispbread is nice and thin  great for those with more sensitive teethbr br i eat  of these in the morning for breakfast with smuckers sugarfree jelly on thembr guilt free and deliciousbr br you do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butterbr if you press too hard they can breakbr br one thing you cant tell from the box is that there are actually  airtight packs in the boxbr br im currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crispbreadbr highly recommend bothbr br note i have lost  pounds by changing my diet but i give the most credit to  things  rye crispbread replacing almostbr all of the flour in my diet  and drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fatbr you do need to exercise a little bit too
4667,5,i love rye used to eat the thick rye crisps but my old teeth just cant handle them anymore  but i still love some crunch i also like to eat healthier and these crisp thins are whole grain and have more fiber than many bread optionsbr br it was getting harder to find them locally so i started getting them here on amazon so i never have to be wo my favorite cracker another bonus  ive had these around the house for years but my kids never showed any interest just some weird thing mom ate until i ordered a whole box of them last month my last daughter still at home thought maybe she should try them since i bought so many now shes hooked so shes taking them off to college with her
4668,5,i was looking forward to this order from amazon ive been on a calorie restricted diet for months and its the taste of grains bread chips crackersthat i miss the most i find these thin crispbreads from kavli to be the perfect solution they are ultra thin i mean they are thinner than you might think possiblebr br as soon as i saw the first one i was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece so far i have not come across a single broken cracker my next thought waswell as soon as i bite into it the things going to explode into a thousand tiny shards i was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been these crackers really hold together nicelybr br the flavor is very plain there is no seasoning and very little salt they taste like the grains they are made from i have ordered a case of the garlic flavor and look forward to trying them i eat these with a generous spoonful of very low calorie pepper and eggplant spread that makes for a very low calorie snack i highly recommend these
4669,5,i have been buying this delicious crispbread for many years but for some reason it is no longer available in stores its an all rye product with only natural ingredients and is just a few calories per cracker because its so thin it doesnt overwhelm the flavour of cheese or tapenade which is my favourite thing to have with the crackers i thought maybe id overdone it by buying two cases but im already into the second box after just a week
4670,5,i highly recommend this product  cant beat the calorie count  my favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces  also great with cheese  healthy product
4671,4,i discovered these when i moved to canada a few years back  before this i had only experienced a thicker wasa crispbread and was a bit put off at first  the feelings dissolved the first time i ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese  they are a little more powdery than id like but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them
4672,5,the title says it all  if you want a cracker that doesnt interfere with the flavor of what youre topping it with but also adds a delicate crunch this is your crackerbr br recently at a friends house we were having some various crackers with a little butter and when i asked what the first cracker was i was presented with a box of kavli crispy thin crackers the only way ive tried them so far is plain buttered or with homemade cranberry jam and theyre hard to put downbr br i was a little surprised to see the other reviews bringing up the healthful aspects of these crackers as the two main reasons i love them so much have nothing to do with anything other than what i want out of a cracker  light crispy texture and delicious flavor
4673,5,hard to find on the store shelves  doesnt over power the flavors you put on it
4674,5,i just tried this crackers and am so pleased they are very very thin but strong enough to hold a spread at only  calories per large cracker x inch size  you really can enjoy a nice treat for under  calories a wonderful find for those of us that try to eat healthy and with some control
4675,4,product was as described it was shipped promptly and i will be consuming it as part of a medically supervised dietit is the only bread that im allowed
4676,5,i discovered the kavli thin crackers in paris at marks  spencer in  and kavli has been since my bread and i was happy when we moved to the us in  to find them also herebr br i can say that kavli has been an important part of helping me to keep my weight
4677,1,dont you know that sugar is the sand of time   since the ingredients of kavli crispy thin were listed on amazon and the time i received my order  sugar  was added to this product  you are going to get in trouble mister
4678,5,it is very strong and pure you just need a little bit to get a great flavor helps with digestion but the smell is strong
4679,2,this tea has no flavor tastes like dust it looks like quality  pretty package  but its no good lipton regular pekoe is farrr superior
4680,5,so okay i dont do hot tea but this is a perfect loose leaf tea for iced tea  am i an expert at ice tea  no but after moving to the south some  years ago i have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere  i will say that most recipes i could find must have been for some cheap tea bags weak somewhat tasteless and bitter so i experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea  the recipe is  cup tea to  cups water  bring the water to a boil take it off the heat put the tea in let it steep for no more than  minutes and strain into a container let cool to room temperature and refrigerate  if you are in a hurry fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice  this works great for this particular loose leaf tea  not strong not weak  oh yes if you like sweet tea add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot
4681,5,these are so tasty i use them when making my cheesecake cookies and in pancakes theres nothing that they cant be used in they taste sweet and not overpowering
4682,4,order these with the idea in mind of putting them in waffles pancakes  a cookiie recipe that i had
4683,4,looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days these were very good  would def buy again
4684,5,i buy gosh thats good sugar free white velvet all of the time  this is the best sf white chocolate that i have ever used  it may be a little expensive but it lasts a long time  buy it and enjoy
4685,4,i have been looking at this product for a couple months and finally gave in  first of all the name got my interest  the taste is delicious but im having problems with the directions  havent figured out if its actually a hot beverage or do you put it in a hot beverage  it has a scoop small and says to put that in a cup instructions for  oz and then put a couple shots of hot water  shots of water  and you can add frothing milk  hum  confused but i guess i will work with it  hope it doesnt take the whole container very large to figure it out i would have given it  stars had i understood the instructions
4686,5,this stuff is amazing  fast shipping and most of all the best tasting sugar free low calorie item on the market  bravo  i use it in my coffee and its a real treatbr br thank you  will be ordering more very soon
4687,5,wagyu beef is a kobe beef japanese cow crossbred with an american cow its the best possible beef you can get in the us and is not illegal
4688,3,i keep these in the freezer when unexpected guests dropin or if one of the staff has guests  what we do prefer is to slaughter the fatted calf but that is not always practical due to anticipating aging times  having just said that i realize that i must institute a detailed and precise slaughtering schedule to insure always having quality beef on handbr br i may have given these kobe steaks four stars if that were my only gripe but i have a problem with  the size  first off these cuts are only one inch thick which is ghastly offensive  i steak should be at the bare minimum two inches thick  i do not even associate with proletarians and can only imagine the horrors that these people committ against decent food  cant these people just eat sensibly or not at all  please dont get me started for i wanted to include sterility drugs in all fast food particularly the bargain menu but that is merely a hope and dream for another daybr br secondly isnt there a law somewhere about a steak less that  two pounds  my heavens this fourteen ouncer is a mere sampler a tease  i suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the yuppies flock to as lemmings to a cliffbr br lastly i must close this review before i become too distraught
4689,1,kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in japan and is illegal to import in to the united states in fact it has been illegal to import since  in any form this is just overpriced regular american beef
4690,5,my youngest cat is very particular about what he eats  he absolutely will not eat if something doesnt meet his expectations  between that and the recent pet food recalls ive had a really hard time finding cat food that i can feed him  im happy to say that the merrick turducken clicks with him plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers  the texture of it is appealing too    its not just mush or spamlooking like many foods  ill continue to buy turducken and plan to also try out some of the other merrick flavors
4691,5,i open a can of this stuff and it looks like real food  i spoon it onto the dishes for my four and it dishes like actual meat and sauce  all four of them dive right into it and all four saucers are licked cleanbr br i have seen the health benefits to my cats from feeding them high quality grainfree food  this turducken canned food is one of the staples of their diet  i love feeding it to them and they love eating itbr br in my view its worth the extra money to get really good food for ones pets
4692,5,really gets the mouth watering a little over  at big the price listed here is insane
4693,5,this is a good deal for a flavor not often carried in the stores the honey berry flaver is a good thing not being to mediciny and things of that nature yum
4694,4,ive used this bbq sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives like corn syrup and for us gluten but the price on this cant be right  order directly from the daddy sams website to pay  oz bottle  this price would have to be a case price although the description says oz
4695,5,this was a cute affordable set for my  yo sons golf theme party  they were a great size for a half sheet cake and hes played with them as toys since his party
4696,5,i only used one green with its ball etc with the golfer on the cake  i made one long hole with fairway sand traps water hazards and green  my hubby loved it for his big th golf themed party  i used the extra golf clubs balls and pins on the decor table around the cake  if i had a huge sheet cake to decorate i could see using the three greens but it wouldnt have fit right on one x cake  knowing i was buying wilton made me confidant that i would be very satisfied and i was  and for the price i couldnt go wrong 
4697,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvmbdiwilton  pc golf set abr br i am very happy with this product i purchased this item for my collages retirement celebration i have received numerous comments wow everyone wanted to know where i purchased these items of course i was proud to say amazoncom i would suggest my friends to purchase this product from wilton as the price is very cheap and the quality is very good
4698,5,the golf set arrived quickly and was just as pictured the birthday for my five year old grandson turned out great
4699,3,the set is bigger than i thought it would be  it would take a very big cake to set up all of this  i ended up using only the golfer and a ball  the golfer is about  inches tall and the clubs are  inches long
4700,5,the best sugar substitute at this time swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste cant wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets
4701,3,my dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food  after trying many varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store the alpo chicken in gravy is all he will eat i can sometimes feed him the tbone steak flavor  i guess it looks and tastes more like people food than the other varieties  my only complaint is that when i received the shipment pack of  almost all of the cans were dented and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can  one can leaked out  the dent was at the seal on the top  normally im not someone who is picky about dented cans but this was a little much  a couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when i opened them  so i guess ill go back to buying at the grocery store  just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store  oh well
4702,5,i am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product im not too much of a fan of the caramel dip but the syrup is equally as delicious as its pancake counterpart i highly recommend it but ask your local grocers to see if theyre willing to carry it this is far too expensive than what i paid going to my grocery store
4703,5,i feed my two pugs and occasional rescue newmans advanced dog formula i like this better than the regular newmans because it has less ingredients i supplement with high quality can food organic free range chicken healthy powder and salmon oil my boys are healthy their coats are amazing highly recommend but with supplementssee above
4704,5,newman products have been used in our home for years after researching newmans adult dog food i felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoos they love it one of them wolfs it down in  seconds really i timed itbr with so many companies recalling dog foodsi felt the newman company being organic would be more reliable keeps me from worrying so much as i pour that bowl of food for them
4705,5,this food is great my  year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since i changed her food i highly recommend this dog food
4706,5,we have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach  we have tried several kinds of dog food for her and newmans own organic seems to be agreeing with her so we will continue purchasing this product through amazon as long as it does
4707,5,love the fact that it is on subscribeand save  the change to this food has had many benefits my dog loves it has aided in the suppression of tear staining hes part beagle part king charles and makes his poo firm
4708,5,i was using organix for a while and was happy with the ingredients and my dog seemed to enjoy it then i saw all the great reviews for newmans own organic dog food along with the great price and decided to give it a trybr br they say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food but i have to tell you from the first day i gave him the newmans own he refused to eat the organix anymore he loved the newmans own so much  even though hed eaten the organix for years i even tried mixing the bit of organix i had left in with the newmans own but he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowlbr br so i dont know what it is but my dog sure seems to love this food hes eating more now and hes very healthybr br again i had no complaints about the organix i think its probably a good dog food but my dog sure prefers the newmans own
4709,5,i have a  yr old pomimo  pomeranian  american eskimo who seems to only like human food although id love to give him human food all the time i know its not good for his digestive system and it doesnt have the proper nutrients required for a dog especially at his current age upon trying various brands including blue and call of the wild i couldnt justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste after reading some positive reviews here on amazon for newmans i decided to give it a go surprisingly my dog started eating the food immediately after i poured some into his dish he never does that with other dry dog food and usually waits to eat after ive given him a nibble of everything that i eat during the day what makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality yes i understand that organic and quality usmade food are naturally more expensive however some of the brands charge double of newmans and provide only half the taste as humans were usually sold by the nutritious  wholesome advertisements when buying dog food however i think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also newmans seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste will be buying newmans as a regular
4710,5,we have been feeding our dog newmans own since she was very young  she was a finiky eater and i was a determined owner who insisted on organic food  both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product  its the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be  years old next month  the only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots  i highly recommend this foodi am sooo glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop
4711,5,im very pleased with this dog food  havent ordered anything else for my dogs since i bought this  my lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and im happy that it is healthy for them
4712,5,i highly recommend newmans own organics dog food natural high is nutrition and with out fillers keep your dogs healthy and with lots of energy for a long time
4713,5,it took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog  thank you for the newmans daughter to keeping an awesome company n caring our pets  stars
4714,5,i switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything  he has eaten precise foundation formula for the almost two years since i adopted him  he often goes off his food andor vomits from time to time  ive tried switching him to wellness and blue buffalo with no positive results  i cant tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the newmansand he looks forward to every meal doesnt beg for other stuff because he is satisfied and he seems to have more energy  he is a lb great pyrenees and finally very happy with his food
4715,5,we have two westies who to say the least have very sensitive digestion systems  since using this product their hair is soft and moisturized they love their food and to boot they are down to their recommended weight were on the automatic delivery program and thats the best no brainer ever
4716,4,the ingredients are really wholesome and fast deliverybr it would be nice if they had some type of fish formula thoughbr but my dog loves them and will buy again
4717,4,we switched to this brand because one of our dogs eyes always teared and someone said it could be from a corn allergy  this is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly  blue brand does not contain corn but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian  it smells more natural than purina one which i had been feeding them and they seem to like it better  i like that the sales from the food go to charity too  a good product
4718,5,weve originally bought this as our dogs first food and then switched to wellness dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to newmans own and now our dog feels a lot better never switched his food ever again
4719,3,my dogs love this food no allergies more energy and nicer coats my big dogs skin doesnt seem nearly as irritated and i am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again we like it m ofore than any other i have seen my only problem is that i have  dogs one huge one and lbs hardly make it a month we really could use bigger bags or a qty discount plus i cannot find this in any stores so when i ran out i had to by a substitutebr update my second shipment did not arrive at all i have been trying to contact buyer but i cannot figure it out had to go back to the old food at least i realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have 
4720,5,this brand is the lowest price i can find in organic dog kibbles the subscription is convenient i wish the company makes  pound bags
4721,5,we have been using this product for over a year now goldie our dog loves it she is  years old now
4722,2,good but not my favoritenewmans own organics adult dog food formula pound bagi now buy my dogs taste of the wild salmon just great stuff buy it on amazon the less fillers the better not meals for my doggies
4723,5,i have two english bull terrier with bad allergies one of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that i bought they have been eating newmans advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for  months now and have not tired of it their skin and mobility has improved and they love it i buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase my local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy
4724,5,received in a timely manner and in good condition my mishka is a little spoiled i cook her meals when i can afford it buy her wellness kibble when i cant but she ate this willingly i bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping unlike the much heavier wellness bag and she was almost out of kibble im happy with the compromise
4725,5,i buy newmans own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas  ive always fed them natural humangrade dog food even though most brands can be a bit pricey  like most pet parents i try to do the best i can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right  most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing  newmans own is more affordable and i feel good about the companys ethics and practices so it was worth a trybr br my dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand  they gobble it up i now have it on subscription so we dont run out
4726,5,year old elkhound loves this food and it keeps her in great health  amazon has the best price ive found for this food and its even better with subscribe and save  i highly recommend it
4727,4,great alternative to dog food with corn and other byproducts our picky dogs enjoy this food and so do i knowingbr it is better their health
4728,5,i feel good about the quality and mix it with canned pn food  she doesnt care for it by itself but then she doesnt like any dry dogfood
4729,5,one of the best for our  year old jack russell mixbr i always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken not a byproduct
4730,5,i have  adult shihtzus and while they do prefer it when i cook for them they do eat this and it has helped eliminate the brownish tear stains they get when i feed them some dry foods
4731,3,ive been searching for a nocorn natural dog food to keep skin rashes awaytried halo which was great but so expensive  this is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to halo butoh boy  im just glad its warm enough to have the windows open  my dog loves the taste and the quality seems great so well try  more days to see if things settle down
4732,4,i read all the reviews before buying this food and overall i was impressed with the product myself  the dogs like it they have no ill effects as  reviewer alleged looking at her other reviews i think hers should be tossed by amazon and i can get it for even less on a subscription with prime which means  day no cost shipping  whats not to love  i do mix this with some prescription diet jd since i have one older dog and  with some allergies and the combo seems to help  bottom line  it is a good product and after doing a ton of reading i dont buy my animals cheap food or anything that i think comes from china i think it does everything it claims
4733,5,my yorkiepoo thrives on this dog food  i ran out two weeks ago no local source bought a competitors so called equivalent only to see my quinn suffer from itching and belly aches  i ordered this from amazon yesterday free shipping they sent it out hours later and i recieved it today
4734,5,my tibetin terrior is  years old and has been on wellness food since birth  i just recently found newmans own organicsbr the price was a bit cheaper plus free shipping to my home  awesome  when i started to gradually change foods  my livibr would eat only the newmans and leave the wellness to later when she was really hungry  so funny  she is the queen and she knows it
4735,4,i dont know why because it doesnt look very appetizing but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon
4736,4,i have been using the product for several months now  the dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice  what more can i say
4737,5,hello i have tried some different foods for my dogbut this is the one she tolerates the besti have a  year old border collielab mix and have been giving her this food for quite some time nowshe loves itthank you
4738,5,the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like newmans i cant find it in my area at all and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her ibs and preservative sensitivitiesbr   easy and cost effective  i only wrestle with the co footprint on having it to be shipped   and am working on finding an offset for that  
4739,5,i feed my  year old toy breed this food and she hasnt complained yet  was feeding her eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare  switched then to only organic brands like wellness  this product has been the best deal on organic dog food i have found and with the subscribe and saveperfect
4740,5,this is a great product very comforting for owners that it is all natural and mostly organic with no by products and preservativesbr br we gave our dog a  year old lab mix petpromise before after the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it but once she did she loves it my dog is quite picky about her food and she likes junk food better rather than wholesome food and treats of course she is very used to newmans own now and it gives her very good bowl movement always a plus
4741,5,i adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn i checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn i thought i would have to drive to nearest pet store  mile round tripto find a corn free dog food then i found this brand on amazon which listed all the ingretents no corn my dog loves it so much i even use it as a trick when training her ill be buying again and again
4742,4,my dog never met a meal she didnt love including this one  the price is very good especially utilizing the subscription option  i make  of the food i feed my dog its very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality
4743,5,very high quality food that my dog will actually eat  always ships promptly and well packaged
4744,5,ive always given my dog what i thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy  after the pet food issues of a few years ago i switched to only organic dog food for her  since she is only  lbs the price difference isnt too bad  i am a free feeder which isnt ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it  because of this she only gets really excited when people food is offered to her  well when i open this bag she comes over and eats asap  good enough for me
4745,1,this food might have great contents but my   lb  yr old poodle doesnt like the taste shes not a picky eater
4746,5,yayy not feeling well today and dreading having to go to grocery store but the one thing i cannot do without is dog food love my dogs low and behold the door bell rang and it was like santa heard me i cant believe how quickly my order came i was so happy i posted on facebook and text to my mother thank you amazon  thank you prime
4747,2,based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it i figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well  the price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it  she smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food  i wont be buying it again but i really wished my dog enjoyed it so i could continue to support this brand
4748,5,i tried many different types of dry food for my picky eater a cavalier king charles spaniel when i found the newmans own i hit gold my dog loves it he licks his bowl clean and best of all it is good for him his coat looks very healthy and his intermittent stomach issues are controlled i am really happy with this brand i wish it was available at more stores
4749,5,i have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also when i look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food it is downright nauseating i bought some of this newmans own and my dog loves it she usually gobbles it up the minute i put it into the bowl
4750,2,i expected newmans own dog food to be great  it may be very nutritious but my little terriers told me we are not eating this stuff  period  no way  after  days they sniffed their bowls and walked away  so i ordered another organic dog food natural balance organics and it came today  so half old half new by the book and they picked out the new stuff and left the newmans in the bowl  go figure  just thought some of you might like to know  i am switching them from iams to something much healthier and i finally think i have a match  but its not newmans
4751,5,this large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog its also worth purchasing this larger sized bag or get two of them at once in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time
4752,5,my dogs love it even the little princess terrier  ive tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far
4753,5,fast delivery  product arrived exactly as described  would purchase again from this company
4754,5,i believe that dog food should be what your dog likes to start withbr br next i think that you should do research to make sure it is right forbr br your pooch all human grade products go into the dog food anotherbr br decision is the size and for  lbs a  pound bag is perfect buyingbr br at amazon is a great way to buy because they have the  pounder
4755,2,if you are looking for an actual organic dog food newmans own is not the way to go i accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic with all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised food animals this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic
4756,2,i cringed a little after reading the ingredient list way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs notice all of them are at the beginning which means they make up quite a bit of the diet soy protein is included but some dogs dont do well with soy mine and meat should be the protein source in dog food not grainsbr not recommended for your furry ones
4757,5,i rotate between newmans nature balance and ceasar milans organic dog food my dog eats all three so cant say which is better my main reason to purchase this brand or any newman product is for the charity the profits goes to my way of supporting companies that give back
4758,5,i signed up for the monthly subscription for this item the price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges i love the fact that i can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvkcnewmans ownâ® organics adult dog food chicken  rice formula pound bagavery pleased with all my orders from amazon extremely pleased with their customer service thanks amazon
4759,1,i purchased two bags of this dogfood after one week of feeding the newman brand my dog started vomiting after eating she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache after having her checked for a stomach disorder i took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappearedbr i have sent three emails to newman dogfood website no replies or acknowledgement phone number not available the dogfood is expensive and the customer service is non existent
4760,5,just signed up for the subscribe and save option  saved a few bucks per bag versus the local store and now it will show up every month  hopefully the rhythm will match the consumption rate of my two dogs the shortest shipping interval is  month but you can trigger an immediate delivery if needed
4761,3,i dont know why this got such good reviews but my yorkshire really doesnt like it he likes iams more than this and its cheaper
4762,1,i feed my dog royal canine brand which i typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat  i thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve  upon opening i could tell i made a mistake  smells like cardboard  my dog wont eat it no matter how i dress it up much less could i get her to eat it plain  plus it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like royal canine  the newman brand is spreading itself too thin here  they should stick with pasta sauce
4763,1,i had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular innova dog food i fed this to my lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced he was going up to  times a day unbelievable this just goes to show how much filler is in this food would never recommend
4764,2,this food is organic sure  however look at the ingredients top  includes chicken meal  never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product  its a cheap substitute and really is bad for the dog  i suggest a brand like evo blue buffalo ect  no ingredient should be meal or by product
4765,3,i guess my animals cat and dog cant read the amous names on bag warpings as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry
4766,1,i have  dogs and all were sick on this food one actually almost died it had to be ressucitated after i spent  on vets bills i decided to call the fda to analize this food they found ethoxyquin on it  a pesticide  i just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem that it must be known im still not happy about this incident i decided not to pursue it any longer but i still feel people should know these organic companies cant get away misleading people if everyone exposed them then this would be a better world think about itbr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbyqmbgnewmans own organics chicken rice advanced dry pounda

4768,1,the number one ingredient is chicken not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldnt eat yourself i will stick to natural balance which is sold here on amazon as well
4769,5,i put this in my dogs bowl and the first time my dogbob saget just licked the bowl clean same ol same ol then i put in some uranium ore and bamy waowi he turned green good results the next day his eyes startes to glow and when i took him for his daily stroll he looked at the neighbors cat and it levitated and exploded good resultsbr  i think ill try some my i have a few people that the world dosent need 
4770,1,i will never again even consider a dog food with corn wheat or soy in it grain has no place in a dogs diet
4771,1,i have to say in the beginningi have not tried this food it had me sold i said oh boy its made by paul newman it has to be good this should not be catarized organic its deceitful it should be advertized as partially organic then you wont be upset that the most important thing you want to be organicthe meatis not who cares if your veggies r organic well yeh it helps def but they dont normally raise veggies with antibiotics etc etcbr so if organic is what ur looking for walk up the aisle to castor and pollux organix dog food every single ingrediant is  o  r  g  a  n  i  c  br shame on you the company of one of my fav actors im truly surprised he let this be under the reviews of organic
4772,5,i cannot express enough how pleased i am with this dog food i feed my  year old german shepard and my two year old pittie girl this food every day and the benefits are astounding  for most of my shepards life i fed her a well known vet recommended food and yet she always had stomach problems  trying many things it was not until i rescued and i should really say she rescued me and the dog food recall that i began doing research on brands of food  after a long investigation i decided on newmans own not only because there had been no recall on the food but because of the ingredients and that the proceeds going to charity now choosing this brand would mean that i would have to order it online because my local stores did not carry it but that was all right with me because not only do i enjoy online ordering but i am an older disabled woman and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me  well i want to tell you my  year old thrives on this food with no more digestive issues and a beautiful white coat and she loves eating it with vigor my two year old american pit bull terrier another love of my life also thrives on this food has the most beautiful shiny coat ever and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is  i do spoil my fur kids but their health and well being is my number one priority  i have just recently switched over feeding my  cats newmans own cat food both dry and canned food and since then i have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls  i know that i am truly a pet lover but i believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them unnecessary medical issues and all around good health a good balanced safe natural food is the way to go  i highly recommend newmans own dog and cat food  i also feed my two dogs newmans own biscuits as treats
4773,5,i adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys  you can imagine the diet she had burgers fries icecream and the cheapest dog foods on the marketbr br no she wasnt crazy about newmans dog food when i switched her to it  but if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense  it takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out therebr br it has been almost a year  my dog molly is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free she gets dry newmans fed free style and  ounces of newmans canned every day  her weight stays stable at  pounds which is perfect for her her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a weekbr br on another note this diet has made doggy duty much easier she never vomits anymore her scat is always firm making her easy to clean up after  she is regular as clockwork  all these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner
4774,5,our dog is  years old and for the last couple of years his stomach has become particularly sensitive we tried various brands of dog food before settling on newmans own our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach it is hard to find though i was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and i was paying almost twice as much as on amazon now i have it set up on amazon to ship monthly
4775,2,we have been using newmans organic dry dog food for over  yearsit was a godsend when we discovered it our little jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itchingafter trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivitiesso we decided to go organicall her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the newmans however after giving glowing reviews for many years we now have to concede something has changedour little jacks itching returned to the point of drawing blood it is clear something changed and i believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once waswe are on the hunt again i am not saying it does not have good quality ingredientsbut if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitivethis likely is not for you too badit once was a superior product
4776,4,ive yet to find any of the dogs i know that love it  i still have my allergic dog eating it but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring  my vet doesnt want me feeding her people food so i add some of newmans or happy hips canned to itbr br ive talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names  the common objection appears to be the soy used in newmans to increase the protein countbr br i am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality social responsible foodbr br i may be the only person who has made the following mistake but assuming you catch the amazon sales make sure you are ordering the bag size you want  i thought i was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag
4777,5,i originally bought this as a replacement for science diets id as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there id was also more expensive than newmans at my local vets office i have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past we tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red we found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her milkbone treats we needed something organic without a lot of beef in it while this one does have some biproduct for protein it doesnt seem to bother my dog at all she also has normal stools every time which wasnt the case even with the id my dog hated the id she would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety with the newmans own it is night and day she scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting it seems like she loves it from the way she eats itbr br a couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem i had with other dog foods i gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now my husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems withbr br on a side note i wish newmans offered a bigger size bag i have to order these all the time due to the  pound bag my husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size it still works out being cheaper than the  bag of  pound id i was ordering so im still happy with it science diet was sending me to the poor house
4778,5,i adopted my dog about  months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for he would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly his stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool i decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research newmans own had all the qualities i was looking for so i switched him to it gradually   purina one and  newmans own at first and gradually more newmans own in the mix until finally  no ever since switching about six weeks ago he has not had constipation or loose stools i also dont hear his tummy roiling after meals like before and despite what a few reviewers have written the chicken and beef used in the pet food while not organic is natural and raised without hormones and antibioticsbr br according to  ingredients list natural chicken  raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a  natural allvegetable diet the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles hormones enzymes antibodies and structural and protective tissues also the beef is freerange anad range fed w no hormones  antibioticsbr br for me the evidence is clear  this is good quality food my dog loves it and i love that when i buy newmans own products the royalties go to charity
4779,5,i subscribe to the  lb bag of advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs  its a great value we have a small border collie mix and she absolutely loves this food i feed it to her in a a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgoubuster food cube large size colors may varya and she cant wait for mealtime every daybr br we got her from the shelter where she was on science diet she had a ton of skin issues formerly had fleas patches of bare skin itchy dry skin and dandruff flakes since we changed over to newmans the skin problems have almost gone away its been about  months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas she has less dandruff and ive noticed a lot less scratching from her in general our dog trainer said it was most likely due to the change in dietbr br her bms are solid and very regular they are also not particularly smelly i have never smelled any gas from her since putting her on the food these are all signs that she is on a great dietbr br also i love the subscribe feature because i dont have to lug heavy bags of dog food from my car to my rd floor apartment
4780,1,weve been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year with happy results  until last tuesday when my latest subscribeandsave bag was opened my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag on the first night i figured shed eaten something bad off the street on the second night i figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street on the third night i started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching and i realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as wed started the new bag i stopped feeding the dog the newmans own and the vomiting stopped for  nights last night i fed her the food again and sure enough she threw up in the nightbr br i trusted and liked this food  and all things under the newmans own brand  but ill never buy their products again they clearly have a dangerous quality control problem
4781,5,we have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems  weve consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like california natural chicken soup for the dog lovers soul royal canin and a couple others that i cant remember off the top of my headbr br my mom picked up this newmans food because it was available at the grocery store  they love the food but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically  his stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before  this food seems like a real winner for us
4782,5,since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet when we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand  we were there at least  time every six weeks they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape no more food alergies no more vomiting made with bells  evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods  other organic food sellers if its good enough for you its good enough for them all mr newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization give this food  weeks see the improvememnt yourself
4783,3,i really want to like this product because of the great things newmans have done and the fact that all the proceeds go to charity i like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic it looks and smells good too unfortunately none of this matters to my dog daisy she just doesnt care for it usually she will sniff it and walk away once she realizes nothing else is coming her way she will usually eat it but i feel bad since she obviously doesnt care for it like i said i really want to like this product but my dog has the final say sadly i dont think i will buy it again
4784,4,our cocker spaniel is now nearly  years old and the solid gold food id been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year agowith no notice on the packaging and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets  after the contaminated food scare even tho solid gold was not recalled i decided to switch and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight  newmans own is a brand i totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years  after a year on this food my dog is doing fine but i do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat  that may be age related as well  but the stomach upsets have stopped  and i feel better knowing i am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula
4785,5,i switched my minischauzers over to newmans own organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow  ive been looking for a good quality dog food rated  stars by dogfoodadvisorcom without going into debt purchasing it  i was feeding them a different brand that was breedspecific food but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere  a few places if they carried it at all only carried the very small bags  lbs and with two dogs one bag would last about    days  plus these little  lb bags cost more than half what the larger  lb bag  cost  i tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me but they conveniently forgot to place the order so i was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags  then i heard about newmans own organics which is rated a better dog food than the breedspecific food i was using and cost  less  and then i discovered that i could buy this food at amazoncom have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery  no brainer  no more running out of food no more driving  miles or more to find it no more hasselsbr br and best and most importantly of all my little guys love it  their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover they seem more active more alert more regular and they actually chew this food they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing  i cant say enough good things about both newmans own and amazons subscription delivery service
4786,5,i have a dachshund  i have fed her newmans own senior formula for the past few years  i used to feed her eukanuba but then when there was that pet food scare with china i started to investigate and found out that eukanuba contained the same undesirable chicken parts as the cheaper dog foods  i wasnt happy  i contacted newmans about whether the products in this food are sourced from the us and i was told by one of their scientists that they are  recently i moved and was unable to get newmans locally so i tried a couple other organic brands  my dog didnt like them and she seemed to have a larger stool  i decided to go back to newmans and order from amazon who i can always count on to carry everything  now shes happy and so am i  and were supporting a great cause because newmans doesnt compromise on quality and also supports charitable endeavors  what more could you askbr br one important thing to consider  if you have a senior dog it is important to feed them the senior formula so they can digest the food easier
4787,5,i had been buying all sorts of superpremium super expensive foods  my local stores kept discontinuing them  so i did my research and found newmans own organicbr br it is certified organic with no hormones antibiotics or chemical additives corn or wheatbr br and my dogs love it of course they eat anything including grass and bird food and several unfit to post on line
4788,5,this food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap my dogs coat got softer within days his breath stopped stinking immediately and he smells a lot better he is more active and seems healthier and happier no more rendering plant floor sweepings for my dog  a month is a small sacrifice to make for my dogs health and well being i honestly dont know why everyone isnt more concerned about what kind of inedible junk they put in regular store bought dog food
4789,5,one of my dogs had irritable bowel syndrome which we tried to address with food from the vet raw food and every kind of dog food in a pet store  a friend told me about newmans and how it cleared up her dogs stomach problems  one day later  firm stools no gas happy dog ecstatic dog parents  my other dog is  and is often mistaken for a puppy due to her good energy and coat  i am so glad we found this food
4790,2,both of my dogs had trouble with this formula allergy wise  it took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food  needless to say i wont buy this product again
4791,5,i have given my dogs every expensive dog food there is orijin blu merrickyou name it and even though they were good this one is the best  no upset tummies during the switch to this dog food either  even my senior dog who always has loose stool now has a firm healthy stool plus newmans own gives all their profits to charity so it really is the best as far as im concerned
4792,2,when one purchases a product that is called newmans organics one would expect organic food  not just the vegetables which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken  i was very very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic  for a couple of dollars more just buy real organic dog food this dog food isnt exactly cheap so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising  this whole greenwashing thing needs to be regulated better  if someone uses the word organic in their description it better be organic  otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate  newmans has a great reputation i buy a lot of their products but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the futurebr br on the positive side my dog loved it she would lick the bowl around the room for  minutes after the last morsel was consumed  i have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good its like the crack cocaine of dog food  she has never been a finicky eater shell pretty much eat anything voraciously but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world  too bad she isnt getting any more of it
4793,5,my foster dog rex came to me severely underweight with nutrient defficiencies and digestive issues  after a few weeks of prescription food i phased him into newmans own advanced formula  not only does he love it but hes gaining weight marvelously and digests it easily  it was recommended by many and has minimal to no fillersbr br personally i enjoy the product because as a lifelong vegetarian it was important to find a food with strict animal compassion practices and newmans own apparently has those  its affordable as well  sticking with it
4794,5,this is a great dog food product  healthy organic and great for sensitive tummiesbr br our lhasa apso is nine years old is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach we started feeding him newmans own organics dog food about  years ago and are really really satified with this product he rarely gets sick eats almost every meal we give him though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but thats okay with other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently  even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospitalbr br at first the only place we could buy newmans own was from a local privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently i was delighted to buy it on amazon the price for the  lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the  lb bag locally i am a prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping i will certainly order it again when we get close to running outbr br thank you amazon
4795,5,my dogs love this food  i have fed my  year old german shepard and my three year old american pit bull terrier for almost three years they have thrived so well on this food my shepard no longer has stomach problems  both their coats are beautiful and i am completely satisfied  when i decided to switch foods i did alot of research on what good healthy mostly organic food to switch them to i chose newmans own not because i could purchase it easily at a local store  because i can not do so i have to order it and have it delivered but because of the ingredients how it is made and because most of the proceeds go to charities i found the best price at amazon and will always order it this way  i truly recommend this dog food to everyone
4796,5,i have not tried this product personally but my dog has and he loves it and is aging well hes getting a bit grey but is as bouncy as he ever was  years ago
4797,5,have two cocker spanielsbr it was a challenge to find the right dog food forbr the older one as he would get very gassy i triedbr at least  different brands with no success thenbr another cocker spaniel owner recommended me this onebr no more gasbr both of them love it their coat is looking so muchbr shinier and healthier and they now shed very lessbr i wouldnt feed my dogs anything else nowbr very highly recommendedbr and the price and service from amazon is unbeatable
4798,5,our dog has always been a little on the lazy side and his coat has been fairly unhealthylooking relative to other dogs weve had in the past when he began to start smelling on top of it we decided to change his dog food to see if perhaps his stomach was becoming upset by his current foodbr br after about a week on the new food he had noticeably more energy and his coat started to become much healthier on top of that the odor that he emitted started to subside until it was no longer therebr br we really didnt expect it to be so drastic were very happy with newmans own dog food
4799,5,i have three dog friends maggie my  year old aussie had some problems worth of problems and she was so sick i thought of putting her down as it turns out there were several issues that the colo springs emergi vet and dr jaime gaynor fixed and one of them one food allergies that had caused severe problems after trying several foods and making all my own dog food we tried paul newman and all was well maggie and her friends thrived well our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from  to  dollars for  pounds also at wal mart is was past its expiration date and rancid thank you amazon it comes freshit is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which i can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date i cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogsour lives are busy i am a nurse and anything that is dependable easy reasonable comes with excellent customer service and my friends maggie lucy and honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day thank you
4800,5,i was a little skeptical about switching over to this brand but im happy to say my dog loves this stuff i dont even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like i did to his old food this stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores cant beat the price with ss also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months
4801,5,prior to switching to newmans own organics dog food my  year old shihtzu was crunching on iams which was fine except that every  months or so hed have stomach problems after switching his poops have been firmer no stomach issues in sight and his coat has gotten glossier and much less flaky duncan likes his new food and so do i
4802,5,my cocker puppy  mos threw up castor and poullex and natural balance and had loose motions so i tried this and he did great  even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops which is great
4803,5,i like newmans own for my family due to its consistent quality and good ingredients i like have the opportunity to provide the same quality products to my animals  amazon makes it convenient to get multiple bags in manageable sizes that appear on my front porch according to my schedule  i got the three fourpound bags talk about portability and storability
4804,5,my new yorkie came from a puppy mill she was clean and well groomed she was not ever in a house when i got her home she was so scared and nervous from the strange surroundings she would not eat or drink and had horrible watery mucous bowel movements after a visit to the vet that showed no  parasites we put on the bland diet i researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food no one in my area lancaster pa has this product i sent for it and weaned her off the bland diet after only two days on this food her poops are solid small and firm i am so thankful she is really doing well and she is a very sweet girl and looks at me with grateful brown eyes
4805,5,dogs love the taste and i love the company especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home
4806,5,we switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chips bowel movements are so much more dense and compact our vet says its a sign of good food nuff said
4807,4,my  dogs love this food and are thriving on it  ingredients are high quality and amazon price is better than anywhere i can get it except on sale
4808,5,i have been feeding this to my standard poodle for quite some time it was recommended by a local dog day caregroomingtraining center called great dog shoppe in seattle they are very specific about which foods they suggest and sell it must meet certain standards of nutrition or its nogo my poodle loves it but even better i offered some to my cousins finicky poodle who just doesnt eat when shes away from home she gobbled it right up and asked for more when i compared the contents of newmans to her brand which was suggested by a breeder there was no comparison newmans own is far superior i get it via subscribe and save so i never run out i save over the store price and its delivered right to my door what could be easier
4809,5,i used to buy this at a local health food store and then they stopped carrying it then i was thrilled when i found it walmart but then they stopped stocking the dry kibble and now only carry the newmans doggie mush in cans so i couldnt believe it when i found it here  amazon really does sell just about everything my shih tzus like it and they do not get sick at all like they did periodically on the nonorganic but still expensive vetrecommended brands
4810,5,humangrade chicken all organic dog food  the food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the subscribe  save program  the profits benefit pet charitiesbr whats not to like
4811,3,i like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available i switched to this when the brand i had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior however neither of my dogs even my chowhound is crazy about it they eventually did eat it but it took a lot of coaxing but the tummy problems did clear up
4812,5,our dog loves this food  he was having serious gastrointestinal problems that werent clearing up  until we started him on newmans own  since then he has been regular happy and healthy
4813,5,i have a  year old aussie shepheeler mix with chronic skin allergies  i tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas  and none helped  other organic dog food also make him itch miserably  but on the newmans own hes stopped the itching and shedding and he absolutely devours this stuff  love it
4814,5,i am very happy i switched from a very popular dog food sold in a lot of vets offices to newmans about  years ago after a bout of stomach distress all has been well with my fur baby ever since  and to have it brought right to my front door for cheaper than i can get it at the local store how can you beat that
4815,5,i like most people switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods settled on this one  my dogs like it and i feel good about it feeding it to them
4816,1,as other viewers have pointed out this dog food contains pesticides and grains among other questionable ingredients the experience with this brand has been disappointing i appreciate newmans own brand but i no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from thembr br i have since switched to blue buffalo as they seem to have the best reputationbr br staceys review sold me on itbr br dog food has changed alot over the past few years as pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers this was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients real meat and rice were substituted with meat byproduct and cheap imported grains particularly corn that were determined to be unfit for human consumption they are taking ingredients that used to be considered waste and packaging it up as healthy  nutritious food for your beloved pet our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet foodbr br blue buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that at least to my knowledge has not soldout yet the food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no byproducts fillers corn or soy we switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsytoxicology verified case of aflatoxin poisoning from the healthy  nutritious dog food we were buying and feeding him this was not cheap food folks this was a wellknown brand highly marketed as natural that we were paying bag for the fda analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins but nothing was done to the dog food manufacturer they are still producing their high priced waste and heavily marketing it as naturalbr br my advice to pet owners read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often blue buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence because it doesnt contain any cheap fillers its more satisfying to your dog so you dont need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical dont wait until its too late for your beloved pet 
4817,3,i have three dogs  two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls  the third one a yorkie has always been pickey for the past couple years i had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise natural ingredients and better health i decided to try newmans own  none of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food no disrespect to the late mr newman  if i mix newmans own with another brand the dogs make an effort to pick out eat the other food and they will tend to leave newmans own in the bowl  if they are hungry and nothing else is available they will eat the newmans own i am not here to knock newmans own  i am simply telling you my experience btw the food is not old it does not smell stale or old
4818,5,the dogs had been eating purina for a long long time i switched to newmans own and i noticed something only a dog owner would be conscious ofthe waste they no longer expel foul odorous waste which purina seemed to do to them regularly since theyve been on newmans their waste is almost odorless and wellit is easy to pick up you can tell its nutritious by what comes out and if you have to pick up after your dog daily like myself youll appreciate the cleaner output
4819,5,my goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while so i decided to try two other brandswhat a mistakebr  newmans own is really the best my dog looks better feels better and the quality of food is very good do not do like i did and experiment aroundmy poor dogs stomachstick with newmans
4820,5,i switched to this food from blue buffalo i hate to say it but around the time blue started doing tv commercials the food started upsetting my dogs stomach perhaps thats a coincidence but it was a reason to switch regardless of the timing the newmans food has been great my dog loves the food he has been energetic and in great health not much more that you could ask the bag of treats that comes in the  lb bag is a fantastic bonus to every bag
4821,5,i rescued my dog a year ago ever since then ive been feeding him newmans i like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isnt a lot of grain type of ingredients all of the ingredients are organic so its really good for my dog ive tried several other brands with my dog but i dont think hes really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular and since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious i decided to stick to this brand ordering it on amazon is very convenient because i can use the subscribe  save feature and set the schedule of when i want the dog food delivered i never have to worry about running out of dog food
4822,3,this solved my pups dog food allergy problems when i started purchasing it i have a husky and a german shepherd but several months ago the itching started again the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed i wrote a letter of inquiry to newmans with batch numbers from the bags but have received no answer since then ive purchased both solid gold wolf king and royal canine  german shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again
4823,5,i bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about  pounds and i feed her a heaping cup everyday also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbzllnutramax cosequin regular strength capsules   counta to help with joint health i purchased this brand of dog food for my  year old mini schnauzer based on the reviews alone she never has had any digestive problems or issues and also isnt a very picky eater so i cannot attest to these two things her stool is firm is easy to pick up from eating this dog food and i have not had any issues with her having diarrhea or runny stool she has been on newmans own organic dog food for about  months and i plan to keep feeding her thisbr br if you want your dog to have a healthy and long life you will want to feed them the best like this organic dog food try avoiding feeding table scraps and make sure they have plenty of exercisebr br make sure you sign up for subscribe and save for that extra  offbr br edit br br edited to say that amazon now only has  off for subscribe and save also the latest bag i received also came with a full size sample bag of treats a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbxeenewmans own organics lamb and barley new zealand ranch style dog treats ounce pack of a it sells for  for  on amazon
4824,5,my chiweenie was having issues with dandruff constipation and a dull coat we researched different dog foods and bought newmans own for active or senior dogs in about  weeks its like having a brand new dog he is so soft dandruff free having healthy movements  and he loves the food i can give him a piece of it as a treat and he really thinks it is ha ha moral of the story we will never go back to bargain brand for just a little bit more our dog is healthier softer happier and its worth it
4825,5,my dogs love it made from excellent ingredients and a great price at amazoncom my chihuahua has allergies and ive noticed she isnt scratching or chewing on her paws anymore
4826,5,its all organic and its on petas people for the ethical treatment of animals list of crueltyfree brands  did you know that the leading brands of dog foods conduct horrible and cruel tests on laboratory dogs  plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge super saver shipping and costs less than the product i used to buy saving me time and money oh yeah and my dogs love itbr br a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbttnewmans own organics adult dog food formula pound baga
4827,5,i have a twoyear old jack russell terrier and she loves newmans own dog food she ate beneful for a year before switching this goes down much easier she doesnt each eat it just because shes hungry she actually likes it i highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less
4828,5,my dog loves it and she doesnt scratch at her ears anymore she used to scratch her ears all the time because she kept an ear infection
4829,5,my two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact i have had to move up the subscription for the  pound bag since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time what i have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which i had in past products have gone away if your a prime member i would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food
4830,5,this is going to be short and sweet  my little  lbs dogs love it easy to eat small bits and its a high grade food souce for them  what more can i say
4831,5,i have been feeding this to my  yr old beagle for years  newmans own is of excellent quality and its certified organic also a large portion of sales are donated to charity
4832,5,the best dog food ever for my dog he has a sensitive stomach and not only does he love it but it totaly agrees with him  my vet also feels its a great product even my dogs teeth are cleaner since being on it
4833,5,newmans own has been an excellent choice for my dog the ingredients are organic and high quality her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vets office also she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew  it was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery but amazon made an immediate adjustment  i like the pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs
4834,5,i have a  year old boston terrier who is not only a picky eater but most dog foods give him bad gas  i searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that while not organic helped relieve the gas problembr after finishing a bag of the old brand i stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought id take a chance and see if hed like it or not  im happy to report that he loves it and it doesnt give him horrible gas at all  his coat is shiny and healthy as well  the only downside i can seelike the other brandis the price  but being that the product is high quality and organic i cant argue that too much  plus with amazons subscribe and save i get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door  you definitely cant beat thatbr overall im very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase
4835,5,my dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater  i felt i was giving him healthy food with no fillers  i also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly  not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great
4836,5,my dogs give this a highfive  ive never tried it but the list of ingredients is sound and it make their tails wag
4837,5,one of my dogs is allergic to almost everything in dog food  newmans own for senior dogs makes all the difference in her health
4838,5,i bought this dog food initally because i like everything that i have tried from newmans products for humans so i thought that my pug chloe may like newmans also well she sure does there is no turning up her nose at it i get it delivered regualry so this negates the need to make a special trip to get dog foodbr br update   the last two bags i recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea i only found out today when i took her to the vet and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food sure enough when i got home and looked in the dog food guess what i cfound on the bottom of the bag tiny mitesit went out into the garbage containersbr br i will return to this dog food in a few monthsshe ahs liked it so much but will wait for a bit
4839,5,my doogie loves it a lot my budget howls though i cant find it steadily at the local stores so catching it on sale is out of the question its great no digestion problems and his skin eyes and coat are much improved so i know its good for him toobr br ive had great results with harmony farms dog food that i orderd through amazon and theres  pounds more for about the same price
4840,5,my dog is really picky when it comes to his food and i usually have to mix his old with his new for a few days until he will eat his new food i opened the bag when my order arrived and gave my dog a taste he loved his new food  this is his second  pound bag
4841,5,i adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn i live in a small town and found no dog food that didnt contain mainly corn this was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it its an added bonus that it comes straight to my door
4842,5,my  lb dog has never refused to eat newmans own organic  im glad that there is a pet food made without junk that i can feed my pet
4843,5,and i love buying it for her not only is it a healthy organic meal i personally like what the newman foundation does with their profits after taxes from their products million has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation i buy newmans own products whenever i can their spaghetti sauce is outofthisworldroasted garlicyumbr br my dog has eaten this food for years and years until out of the blue my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore i then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get beneful apparently her digestive system didnt like it and she ended up with bloody stools thats when i came to amazoncom a godsend for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from and found her newmans own dog food i can always depend on amazoncom ive now got this on autodelivery i trust newmans own products and i know my dog is getting a wellbalanced organic meal and its melaminefree
4844,5,newmans own is the best dog food ever in my opinion my  year old white german shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully before changing to this food a few years ago she had digestive problems often even though she was fed a so called good brand name food  my three year old pittie girl also eats this food and loves it  she is in perfect health i would recommend it to anyone my next door neighbor orders it now from amazon for his pittie girl amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food groceries and anything you need  the prices are always good and the specials are great the specials are the best ever and i was shocked to find out that a today friday special price on newmans own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the newmans own  even though i just received a bag yesterday i ordered two more today and some newmans own cat food  what other retailer would automatically do that for you  none that i know of  amazon  please continue to offer the newmans own dog food  i would be lost without the delivery since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food  thank you for being here for me and snowey and sophiebr   linda
4845,5,i have two small dogs who have asinbzpkm newmans ownbr organics advanced dog chicken  rice formula  pound bag  their only treats were cheerios  when i switched to newmans own brand i was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting  with all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry i immediately thought if i cant trust paul newmans foods whose can i trust  and they love it
4846,5,my dog is allergic to most dog food  i have used newmans own  dog food  for several years now and i am quite happy with it  i live in a small town that is  miles away from the nearest big city and i am unable to obtain the dog food locally  it is a real convenience for me to buy this from amazon and the price is equitable
4847,4,i was giving my dogs science diet puppy food from the time i got them at  weeks science diet changed the formula about  months ago and the food just did not smell or look right it was very oily and fishy smelling which i realize they did at more fish oil after about three weeks of the new food i noticed my puppies well now  year olds skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws i took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies he wanted me to take them off the science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for  weeks well under duress i tried it and my dogs did not eat for  days i decided to try the newmans organic and after about  weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased i am so glad i saw this food when i was doing research
4848,3,my dog loves this food  i really like that it is organic especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods  i will continue to buy this brand in the store  i would rate the product as a br br the problem i had was with subscribe and save  i started out buying at a very decent price  after only  months the subscription price had increased by almost   no notice on the increase was sent to see if i still wanted it either  i believe amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase  my other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one  subscription rating 
4849,5,i foolishly purchased the harmony farms healthy  holistic adult dog food since it had more for the same pricewhy it had good reviews is beyond me my dogs will not touch the harmony farms yet love this dog food my  wk old pup had slimmy poop until the day i feed her this food both my dogs love itnewmans own organics adult dog food formula is the way to go
4850,1,the chicken is not organic it is the main ingredient this is not organic dog food it is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken
4851,5,we only feed our dog dry food and it has to be good dog food newman brands are high quality and i can get it delivered on a periodic basis and a fixed price thru amazon ginger likes it and it keeps her healthy i have learned over the years that this man and his company are highly moral and deliver fine quality products they stand behind
4852,5,my three little dogs love this food and i love it too sense it is organic and has no animal by products
4853,5,this dogfood has never been recalled has protein as the first two ingredients and is organic doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness cant get better
4854,5,excellent i needed a dog food without copper as an ingredient and found newmansbon the internet it has proven to be a great choice and my dog had thrived
4855,4,i feel better about feeding this product to my dogs  i was using another popular brandbr but it contained a lot of fillers  one of my dogs is pickier so he would prefer a meatierbr taste but he does clean it up eventually
4856,4,good product dogs are vary satified with it  would like to have in a larger bag lbs if this couldwould be an option
4857,5,my dog has been eating this food for the last three years  every food i fed him before this caused smelly gas problems  he almost never has gas on this food  also people often comment on how good he smells  however when he goes to grandmas and eats junk food for a week or two he always comes home smelling like a dog  its totally the food  on top of that he loves it  love it
4858,5,we were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle newmans own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the us per their corporate veterinarian newmans own is up front about their ingredients for an organic food it is affordable also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control lastly newmans own is listed as a more responsible pet food company on several websites
4859,5,newmans own food is one of the best on the market  it is a natural healthy food for my senior dog
4860,4,i am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it  all  of my dogs  jack russells and  dachshund enjoy newmans own dog food and i liked knowing it was organic  the kibbles are a perfect size for easy chewing  my dogs enjoyed newmans own for about  months but then only nibbled on it so i decided to alternate it each month with another dog food to give my dogs some variety
4861,5,researched the company researched the ingredients customer service people are great sent free coupons when emailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties regular or advanced  received good answers and not rote replies this food is made in the usa with products from the usa and has all the ingredients i think are good for my cats the two of them love love this dry food and i have to ration it or they would chow day all day i dont leave food out for any pet cat or dog to eat at will they do not like newmans canned food however so i dont force it on them
4862,5,this gum is amazing the flavor burst in your mouth and it also has a wonderful refreshing sensationbr we love it my husband and i
4863,2,i bought a big pack of this gum  the flavor kiwi watermelon is ok but it didnt last long i found i would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about  minutes to get another shot of flavor  i wouldnt really recommend this gum its not horrible but not that great either
4864,1,this gum is the worst i have ever purchased plain and simple within two seconds of chewing taste gone
4865,3,tastes very good  i really like the tastebr br but then it is gone  like it was never there  so fleetingbr br takes two pieces to really enjoy alsobr br and be very careful not to eat it  seriously it is hard not to swallow it  laugh all you want  you try it and see what i mean
4866,1,ive never had an allergic reaction to any food or anything else in my life  but within  seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted  thats strange because ive been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction  i tasted another piece from another pack we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in iraq and again my throat started burning  so if you have a history of food allergies you might not want to try this flavor
4867,5,im really picky about the gum i chew  this is great and the flavor lasts a long time  i recommend it
4868,5,this is great cheese a little sharp yet creamy with slight bits of crunchy great with a micro brew the merlot and raspberry are yummy too
4869,5,my baby loves this apple sauce he didnt like the gerber brand at all but yummys this down right away and i like that it is organic
4870,5,our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by trader joes  you get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring  wowits a great snack that you feel good while eating  it is my favorite of trader joes almond snacks  almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein the healthy fat and the vitamin e that almonds offer its a good idea to measure out  cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein
4871,1,are you kidding me  i buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under  no more then  at reqular stores watch these prices guys
4872,1,i absolutely love this stuff but i pay  to  for a pack in the grocery store  why is this price so high
4873,1,you can get these sooooooooooooo much cheaper at wholesale clubsbr br i get the ozyes oz for  or  its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store
4874,5,i lived down in louisanna for  years and community coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee here in iowa i cant buy the comm coffee so when i saw the ad to order through amazon i jumped at the offer i got  bags of the hazalnut and i am in coffee heaven right now thanks amazon
4875,4,after becoming more and more a coffee person ive been trying various brands and flavors in an attempt to figure out which one i prefer ive tried other brands such as dunkin kirkland and various other store brands i came across a great deal on a  pack of community coffee so i decided to try it the packaging isnt the best once you open it but i have separate air tight containers which i use as i imagine most coffee drinkers would ownbr br i prefer darkbolder roasts and i found that community coffee definitely fit the bill my girlfriend didnt like it claiming it was too strong which further reinforced my belief that it was at the right level for me i brew the coffee the traditional way coffee pot but also via cold brewing ive found that the cold brewed version of community coffee far surpasses the traditional heatbrewing product im not quite sure if this is the case for almost all coffees but it seems even more pronounced with community coffee
4876,4,this coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn i am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good it just doesnt typically taste like hazelnut you may like it but i will search for a more true hazelnut flavor do a test make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the similarities
4877,5,hazelnut coffee is my favorite and our local stores dont carry it as we live in a very small town  the flavor and taste of this coffee is wonderful  i  start every day with it and often have an afternoon treat of a cup of the coffee  i will buy again and highly recommend arived far earlier than i anticipated
4878,5,awesome coffee i have ordered this pack of bags twice now and getting ready to order a third if you like dunkin donuts hazelnut but dont like the price this is a great and inexpensive alternative
4879,5,we first discovered community coffee while on a visit to lake charles la and until recently it was only available in la or by mail  we prefere the hazelnut blend it has a nice rich flavor without being overly strong  this is very good coffee  we like it and have a standing order with amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient intervals
4880,4,im not a coffee snob so im not picky about what kind of coffee i purchase i chose this because it was cheapest by the ounce and best rated i bought a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeowothe coffee bean  tea leaf handroasted hazelnut ground coffee ounce bags pack of a as my first ground coffee and i have to say community coffee smells and tastes better than coffee beans this is totally personal preference thoughbr br this community coffee ground tastes much darker and smoother and it smells good
4881,4,im no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk great coffee for a great price especially if you get it when amazon is offering the  off coupon
4882,5,i dont drink hazelnut coffee but my wife says this is the best she has ever had and asked me to buy more for her
4883,5,we enjoy community coffee when we go to new orleans i was glad to see it available in your online store
4884,5,very pleased with this new coffee thanx to another user comment and good review from someone recently when i was searching for a better priced coffee plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent all the others are ridiculous on pricing i have noticed increasing by  or  in some cases  i was getting maxwell house hazelnut but this coffee is much tastier and maxwell house has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing communitys bolder flavored hazelnut  you can actually taste hazelnut in community coffee  its a bit bolder but i like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee yeah  i do not buy or search for maxwell house any longer nor do i enjoy folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of community hazelnut coffee  i just hope that now finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price amazon keeps it in stock for awhile
4885,5,it is not the best but for the money and that extra  off its the best value you can get i am very happy with my purchase and now i can drink good coffee everyday as opposed to the crap office coffee or that onceamonth expensive coffee after buying this i was satisfied enough to buy another pack of cafe special note the expiration dates on my hazelnut bags are 
4886,5,i gave this a try when it was on special and i totally love this product iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffees that tend to break my bank account give it a try
4887,5,my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have  this community hazelnut has excellent flavor  we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee
4888,4,not the best coffee but it is not bad as well we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price weve got it is fine godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too
4889,1,i hated this coffee  im much more of a starbucks or peets loyalist so maybe im a bit spoiled  but after reading many positive reviews of this company i decided to give it a try  big mistake  i had a hard time giving it away  it definitely tastes like chicory  blagk  bad news
4890,1,i bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat and with a name like beneful i thought i was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food my dogs did eat this food but after reading the ingredients i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs the first three ingredients are ground yellow corn chicken byproduct meal and corn gluten meal how disgusting is that the main ingredient is a corn filler one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot when you eat corn what comes out of the other end the same thing happens with dogs basically dogs cannot digest corn it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full poop out more and retain less nutrients the only meat in beneful at all is a byproduct its not even a real meat byproducts are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested were talking beaks chicken feet eyeballs even chicken poop i would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i cant believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertisingbr br i recommend to stay far away from beneful and most purina products when purchasing a dog or cat food the most important thing to consider is the first  ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for  i usually buy my pets all natural organic foods such as blue buffalo halo or wellness
4891,5,id rank toffifay as tied with ferrero rocher for the greatest chocolate candy ever sadly toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live i thought ordering  packs would be overkill but im going through these things like nobodys business at this rate ill have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen
4892,2,when i got this it was melted through the package and what wasnt completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers  you would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold  i wasnt very happy with it  i love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good
4893,5,this candy has gotten harder and harder to find  it was down to a couple convienence stores in my area that sold it and they stopped  now a year later i typed in toffifay into bing and up pops amazon  great price for a great candy and im well stocked up for the next  months  the hard part is not eating it all the first week
4894,5,i have been looking for this candy for over a year i used to enjoy this as a young kid and now its back all there is to say is yummy
4895,5,i heard my kids talking about candy they remembered from childhood and they mentioned toffifayso i checked amazon to see if it was still being sold it wasand reasonably pricedi ordered a  packand divided it among their christmas stockingsthey were really surprised and happy to find it christmas morningim glad i thought of searching amazon
4896,3,i thought this would be the perfect candybar i love hazel nuts i love caramel and i love chocolate  but there is something about the chocolate filling that i dont likebr   they claim a whole hazel nut in each piece but its probably only half  its an ok candy but i will never ever buy it again ill stick to snickers with almonds
4897,5,i have been experimenting with kcup brews for almost  years now  i tried timothys colombia excelencia only because it was on sale and i was still looking for the one  well i finally found it  columbia excelencia is the best breakfast coffee i have found to date  rich fullbodied with a clean nonacrid finish  it goes well with milk and splenda no odd aftertaste whatsoever  donut shop is my favorite over ice newmans nantucket is my favorite bold timothys italian goes best with dessert and colombia excelencia is the first thing i drink every morning
4898,2,very weak blend slightly bitter aftertaste  noticeably light brew when brewing  wont purchase again in fact i regret this purchase  even on  oz brew still really weak taste
4899,5,i have tried many different brands and flavors of kcup coffees and i have to say this one is one of the best i have ever had i would strongly recommend it it is very hard to find so buy it if you can get it at a good price
4900,5,this coffee is bold dark and tasty unlike many other types that are too watery and weak this one brews nice and strong cup of coffee
4901,4,i thought this coffee was really good but i think the next time i order i will order something a bit stronger
4902,5,this is by far the best decaf ive ever tried you cant brew it on the large cup setting you have to brew it on the  oz setting dont try to stretch it to the  oz or it will be too weak however when brewed at  oz this is smooth tasty and tastes like coffee not bitter and you cant tell its a decaf
4903,5,i am from colombia and i was looking for a coffee that tasted like back home everyday when i make coffee and the aroma is in the whole kitchen  it feels like home and it tastes just like it i love this coffee
4904,3,we have been experimenting with different brands of kcups since we purchased our keurig last christmas  while this one was okay it just is not as good green mountains breakfast blend for an everyday staple  we havent tried green mountain columbian yet as a closer comparison  however when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one the brew is noticibly weaker than with gm breakfast blendbr br also please note that we love timothys world italian blend  it is definitely amount our favorites
4905,5,we love this medium fullflavored roast very smooth tasteno bitter or acidic taste at allexcellent coffeegood value    also try timothys konavery goodalso
4906,5,my husband has been taking this sinus buster tea once a day before bedtime for about  months already he usually had a real bad sinus problem before but now it is almost completely gone this tea is so wonderful and it really helps  when he skipped for a few days because ran out of it then the sinus came back again dont want to skip it for so long anymore highly recommended
4907,5,im very happy with this drains my ears and sinuses quite effectively  works better for me than guaifenisen
4908,4,the sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping its taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee i had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning i could feel relief of pressure and pain i would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent as a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown
4909,5,i found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered itbr br after not being able to find it again  it really helps open nasal passagesbr br since starting to use it whenever i have bad nasal congestion i have notbr br had a sinus infection  everyone is different but it sure worked for me
4910,5,i used it for a sinus infection where i lost my voice completely and had a sore throat i found this product on yelp and went to an herbal asian store in chinatown in phila i only paid  the only difference is that i didnt get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water it worked great it took a few hours to work but it worked the next day i had my voice back completely and no sore throat one night i woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep a must buy its cheap and natural you cant go wrong if you give it a try
4911,5,its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed  i dont particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants  this is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work  i have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders  smells a bit off but the taste is just fine  make sure to seep it for  mins or it wont work  give it about  mins to kick in  seems to last for  hrs  no side affects that i can tell  so glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth sore throat that comes with sudafed  it works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot
4912,5,i love this tea  seriously  my mom and i suffer very bad with sinus problems and we heard about this tea called sinus busters  we just had to see what all the talk was about  you know  it is a very good tea that takes your blues away and make you sleep great  aloha 
4913,2,after reading all the great reviews i optimistically ordered some of this tea ive had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success  unfortunately this really didnt do anything for me  the taste is ok bearable but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion  so far the only things ive found that have helped me somewhat are the vicks personal warm mist humidifier and neti xlear
4914,5,i have been suffering from post nasal drip and congestion for so many years and this tea made such a big difference after a couple of days i drink it  times per day and i feel so much better i can breathe easier and have little or no post nasal drip throughout the day
4915,5,not sure exactly what is in it but it really helps my sinus condition  a family member who spent time in china said it tasted like other healing herbs she had had while there  the taste is earthy and takes some getting used to but it is worth it
4916,1,this tea didnt do anything steal have issues with itching throat ear and everything else but i do enjoy the smell of it ill say it last up to a few hours and thats it
4917,3,ive suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years every time i get an infection my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult i often have to resort to using afrin to decongest my sinuses which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic long term solution because of rebound congestion now i already irrigate with a motorized system often upwards of x daily when im sick and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease that being said i bought this tea out of sheer desperation ill try and have tried next to anything to give myself some relief while i wait for antibiotics to take effect the only thing which i find works even close to as well as afrin is to megadose on psuedoephedrine   times per day which is something that is also unsustainable so keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic what i found with this tea is that it seems to help but i cant tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims yogis breathe deep and cold buster celestial sleepytime sinus soother and other respiratoryaiding herbal formulations ive brewed it doublestrong to try and gain the greatest effect and again it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing the taste is a little bitter but i suppose thats a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it all in all i am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that i can buy at the grocery store as an aside i find celestials sweet and spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas ive tried though its not at all marketed as something for this purpose if you read everything they put in it though it makes sense that it would help
4918,2,i had high hopes when i purchased this produce shipping was amazingly fast and ive tried it a few times i dont enjoy the taste and since i dont sweeten my tea it wasnt that great and it did nothing for my sinuses will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller
4919,1,i bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache earache toothache i drink multiple cups over a few days and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect taste is soso but thats not really what matters as every sinus sufferer knows if eating dirt would make the pain go away wed eat dirt
4920,4,i am having to change my original post on this tea my husband and i both suffer from sinus problems i made up a big tea pot with  tea bags and let it steep for  minutes i had  cups and my husband had one neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses a few days later i decided to try the tea again i brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag i let it sit again for several minutes i guess the first time i tried it i did not make it strong enough this time i noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer
4921,5,i used to take sudafed for my stuffy nose i tried this tea and felt relief immediately i usually drink this tea twice a week and have not yet felt the stuffy nose would highly recommend
4922,5,i bought this tea based upon some research i had done into the ingredients and by reading the reviews posted here  this tea has a wonderful flavor and smell  i have enjoyed it very much and it helps me at bedtime with my sinus issues  great stuff
4923,5,i am so please that i was able to get the tea from amazon  i was pleased with the service  sinus buster herbal tea is very helpful and it gives me great relief with my allergybr br i have been suffered with hay fever allergy for the past  years or more  first time i find a medication which is natural and no side affects compare to other medication for allergybr br i discovered the tea at a farm market in pa on a bus ride with my church  at first i was hesitated to purchase the tea but somoeone who was in the same but i was told me to buy the tea because she used it a year ago and got great relief from it with her allergybr br thanksbr br mc
4924,5,but a naturapath told me to take this vitamin d vitamin c and something he mixed and i got better from a month sinus issue
4925,5,we love sinus buster tea  my husband thinks its great and clears out his sinus regularly
4926,1,i have ordered numerous teas potions lotions and other remediesbut have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed  the tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside  i would have said something sooner howeveri only tried these when i had a sinus infection and the last  times i tried to use onethe sealed pouch was empty  beware
4927,5,i absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sinus headaches  my brother had given me a couple of bags to try a few months ago in the past i have had serious sinus headaches  after drinking this tea my headaches were gone and the clicking in my nostril had ceased i was so relieved i have recently drank this tea for a dry cough big mistake it gave me a sore throat as well as other issues  i will never drink it for the common cold symptoms  love this product though
4928,2,all natural beef but too soft for my taste  doesnt have the snap and drier outer surface that some like  this is a matter of personal taste  the product is good just not for everyonebr i suggest trying this companys old fashioned coldsmoked beefsticks  strong hickory flavor a good bite of spice and drier texturebr this company has superb customer service
4929,3,buffalo bills premium snacksbr br i realize that taste is an individual thing but i thought id share my thoughts on these productsbr br first customer service is excellent  ive always gotten exactly what i ordered in a very timely mannerbr br so far ive ordered the following productsbr br  buffalo bills lbs mild short shotsbr br  buffalo bills lbs hot short shotsbr br the first two short shots are very similar to slim jims just not individually wrapped i just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on about a quarter pound per bagbr br  buffalo bills lb extra smokeysbr these are very smokey but a little too dry for my tastebr br  buffalo bills oz premium hickory beef jerky pieces random sizebr taste great if you are a jerky loverbr br  buffalo bills lb pepperoni  short shotsbr probably the closest to slim jims of all the short shotsbr br  buffalo bills lbs honey strungbr ok taste  my wife hates the smell  my brother doesnt care much for them eitherbr br all in all i highly recommend these products in the order listed and this companybr br gunner  january

4931,5,good light taste  not too strong of a flavoring and very little if any aftertaste  they go down easymmmmm  definitely happy with the purchase
4932,5,i learned about these from a coworker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago  he spread them around and so i got to sample a variety ive ordered the honey stung four times since then two other coworkers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and theyre believers too  additionally weve all ordered several of the buffalo bills brands and theyre all superb  as long as you dont eat the whole bag id also call these atkins friendly as well as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times other than them being just being great wellseasoned snacks  buy em youll love em
4933,4,i enjoyed this product  they are a good value for the amount you get  i did not sense much honey in the product so a bit more flavor would be nice  i would buy again
4934,5,i though it was fresh moist  however personally alittle to sweet for me  i think ill stick with the john wayne brand  jw brand is more expensive but it seems to soot my taste buds better
4935,4,i was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but i am happy i did they were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in the teriyaki was milder than others i have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole smokeys i did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste all in all worth a  rating but it could be a  based on individual tastes
4936,4,these snacks are very different than say slim jims they are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there there was a nice hint of spice laced with honey i would say they tasted and had a texture that i might have expected in a more expensive product i will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family
4937,4,i bought the buffalo bills teriyaki ole smokies beef sticks because i absolutely love beef sticks especially teriyaki and i thought this would be a good buy  good quantity for the pricebr br the teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful i also loved the texture it was very soft and tenderbr br the only bad thing id have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to fully enjoy the product aside from that i may still order it again 
4938,5,i purchased the honey stung smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy i wouldnt go that far but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a snap to them the taste is great even the picky kids liked these smokiesi think we will try some of the other flavors plus order these again
4939,3,tried mild onlybr br amazon  on br br probr good weight price valuebr br conbr mushy was hoping it would be drier  firmer like other reviews statedbr no snap to skinbr so so flavorbr br hot buffalo bills lbs short shots taste good  have better texturebr also better priceweight ratio  smaller peices means better portion control
4940,5,really great snack for hiking or a baseball gamemy son and i enjoy taking them when we go on a road trip to hold us over till we find a good restaurant
4941,4,taste great once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk anything from this supplier is good quality and value
4942,5,these have a good snap when you bite into them and a nice honey beef tastebr choo choo r snacks always has excellent customer service and they throw in a few samples as well
4943,5,i really enjoyed these beef sticks even though i preferred them to be a little bit harder they were tasty i just put them in the frig and that worked out fine nice flavor not too sweet or spicy they sure didnt last in my house
4944,5,i like this product very much the honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others ive seen the saddlebag package is ingenious why open and expose to the air all  when you only have to open half at a time leave one half  completely sealed one package of  thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time use for emergency sheltersmountain climbing backpacking camping hiking survival training or any survival situationtheres plenty  so you could sustain yourself a long time if lostjust these very light storable beefsticks and a jar of peanut butter unopened and a large jug of water in a vehicle could sustain life for a very long time at a minimum of space and weightthey appear kind of home made unlike any beef sticks i have seen in stores before my dogs like them alsoi break off pieces whenever they need a treat i see nothing in the ingredients that suggest dogs cant eat themhowever i want each person to evaluate this on their own not just because i say so my  dogs have had pieces of them now and then and love them and havent shown any signs of being sick or having less energy i recommend them
4945,5,i love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say mild instead of spicy it isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so i thought i was actually purchasing spicy this time still a wonderful product
4946,5,could only find at local shell gas stationnow i have a source to buy all i want  fast  secure deliveryprice is great  will order again and again etc
4947,4,these beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair there is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated
4948,5,beef sticks and honey  what a great combination the ole smokies beef sticks are full of flavor adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top the honey stung ole smokies are always a favorite with our friends the saddlebag pack is a perfect takealong to football parties
4949,2,i couldnt resist the price so many beef sticks for so cheap however i think i was expecting something different the jerky has a good taste and at first it wasnt very oily but as they got older and exposed to the air i did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks overall if you can consume this say within  week of opening they are great if you need something that will stick around longer stick get it then maybe this isnt the right product they also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order and the shipping was quick i like the company the beef sticks just werent what i was looking for i guess
4950,5,this wine actually turned out really well  i made some modifications to the kit however  if you figure out the potential alcohol content this kit would probably get around  but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation i ended up with   i also didnt use the whole fpack  it would have been way to sweet  instead i topped the carboy off with an unoaked chardonnay that i like
4951,5,i have now made a few of the amazon wine kits the cornucopia are all fruity flavored sweet wines within a month of bottling the pear chablis our  bottles is down to  remaining we have given as gifts and taken to get togethers my only negative comment is that the starting specific gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines i did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginningbut worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine anyway the pear chablis is a nice easy drinking wine it has an attractive label i used clear bottles and the final product looks sharpbr if you are looking for straight wines that are not sweet fruit flavored wines check out the vino italiano kits these also come with corks foils and labels they are a higher alcohol wine than the cornucopia kits with a starting sg closer to 
4952,5,just bottled this wine about  weeks ago  opened the bottle yesterday and wow  i cant believe how good it is lots of pear flavor and having experience with this brand i know that when i let it sit for a couple months it will be much better the sweetness mellows out a little but still is great i have made about  of the cornucopia wines all with good results  if you like the sweeter wines you have to try this
4953,5,i bought this kit and i have to say that it was a hit it was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off  of these for  of the white zin that we were making for a friends wedding at the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them my answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles i would be happy to make it for you i do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for mebr  i did add one can of white grape concentrate after the fpack was added and that added so much more flavorbr  i promise that you cant go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay
4954,5,this turned out fantastic a little sweeter than i expecting but still great may even consider this a dessert wine its nice using cornucopia kits as they come complete with all the supplies you need corkslabelstoppersetc i only use distilled water in the making of the wine dont want to chance it with anything else they have always turned out great give it a trythe farmwiner
4955,5,this is definitely sweet but thats how i like my wine  no backsweetening needed  it has a pear flavor and chilled  well its my favorite
4956,4,good kit however using the fpack pear juice made it way too sweet i ordered two more and intent to blend the kits the second two with out the added pear juice
4957,5,i would call this a summer winelight with strong pear notes almost clear in color nice finish and a good wine for those who dont really like wine
4958,4,i bought this kit after i really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer  it was equally easy to make but it is very peary  i wouldnt have minded it if it was more subtle  still very drinkable but i suspect that ill be mixing it more
4959,5,this is my th kit i have made and as usual it is simply amazing i am truly hooked on all amazons wine kits as they have all turned out better then i have ever imagined for the price i couldnt be happier with the results and will continue to purchase these kits to add to my wine cellar i am in the process of fermenting the barolo and am eagerly anticipating the end results
4960,5,this is my third wine kit and its going so fast i should order another  we took samples from all three kits to a thanksgiving gettogether  more than once i heard whos going to finish off this bottle so we can open another pear
4961,5,hour powers ingredients are pretty much the same as its rival hour energys so obviously the effect is pretty much the same yet this cost me  for  while the other cost me  for  at the nearest storebr br great savings even if you only need these just a couple times a weekbr br the taste isnt as tangy and addictive as hour energys berry flavor a bit bland in comparison but its still nowhere close to bad
4962,4,this stuff will give you a marked energy boost note that every person is different  for me this lasted  hours before the crash  not a sugar crash but my heart was pounding like it wanted to burst through my chestbr br so i only drink half at a time like another reviewer and it works without the scary heart accelerationbr br its even tasty
4963,3,six hour power does help to create a more energetic and alert state  the affect does not last anywhere near six hours  for me it was a couple of hours  it is not as strong as five hour power high strength but it is not positioned as high strength either  for the money i would buy this again over the regular five hour power product
4964,5,the  hour power energy shot does just what it says  a lot of times i only drink half the bottle to achieve the mental alertness that i look for  its one of the best energy shots out there when you figure in price taste and effectiveness
4965,1,i guess it does the job okay  and its much cheaper than hour brand  but the packaging it arrived in was in spanish  since i dont speak or read spanish i was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panelbr the item is labelled as being made in the usa but the website on the label has a mx extension for being a mexican companybr i dont have anything against our neighbors to the south  i just expect that when i buy something on amazon that the labeling will be in english unless otherwise stated
4966,3,my husband works outside all day long due to the recent heatwave his body is depleted of fluids due to sweat my husband uses the energy shot along with zipfizz the zipfizz provides the necessary potassium to keep the body going i personally do not recommend too many energy shot drinks during the day but they do prove beneficial to help you keep going
4967,5,pros free super saving shipping small juicy taste diffrent flavors and healthybr br cons sometimes seller only haves  vs  to order i like to have several packs
4968,2,i took a chance with this product even though there werent enough good reviews since they are cheaper than  hour energy  they did not work for me so i tried red rain which did work and was even cheaper  red rain did work for me so i am done with  hour energy and  hour power the ingredients are pretty close to  hour energy but someone is lying since it doesnt work
4969,1,ive tried a few of the different energy shots and found that the  hour energy have a flowery note lavender in all of their flavoursbr br i cant say i like it the effect is ok but the flavour is like badflat orange pop and is otherwise uninspiring i think id prefer the more standard berry flavour of other shots vs this one
4970,1,i had to be taken to the er in an ambulance earlier the day before yesterday i was having seizures nearsyncope passing out but still being somewhat conscious couldnt breathe and my blood pressure was at stroke level i felt like and thought i was dying or maybe already dead for about  hours it was painful and horrifying i think i figured out what it was that caused my neardeath experience it was probably the energyshot i took  minutes before then i dont usually take something like that someone offered it to me and i was so tired i didnt even look at the bottle and took it please dont use these
4971,5,being from greece i can say with certainty that this is an original cretan olive oil its pure and full taste makes it ideal for cooking salads and dressings we were thrilled to find here in usa an original product deriving from our country and my wife likes to use it every time she cooks resulting in tasty and full flavored foods i would strongly recommend this basic component of the mediterranean diet to anyone who want to improve his nutritional habits
4972,5,i use this olive oil for salads dipping bread in it hummus and sauteing veggies and meat its a very high quality oil with a delicious taste try the oil by itself and compare to another olive oil and youll see the difference ive gotten my girlfriend and my mom both hooked on it in addition it has been great getting to know nick who helps manage the production as compared to what you buy in the store from a big brandsince he goes to the farmers markets here in cincinnati and lets people sample the oilbr br ive only recently found how much better local veggies and other products at the farmers market can really taste all for just a couple extra dollars a bottle of olive oil lasts a long time so paying a couple extra dollars compared to buying another cheaper brand is more than worth it
4973,5,im a little biased in my review but i firmly believe that mt kofinas extra virgin olive oil is the best olive oil you can buy it has the best blend of flavor and low acidity that ive tastes anywhere ive tastes olive oils that say they have  acidity levels but then they dont taste like anything at all ive also tastes olive oils that claim all sorts of awards that have made me have a coughing fit from their pepperiness heres what i think its all about the flavor and mt kofinas simply tastes the best also since its sources from one area im not worried about any other oils being in my delicious extra virgin olive oilbr br if you want to taste some truly delicious olive oil that doesnt cost a lot try mt kofinas olive oil
4974,5,i picked up my first bottle at our local farmers market  we loved it so much  so flavorful  but sadly there is no farmers market in the winter  so glad to see it on amazon
4975,5,this olive oil is great  tastes very good and is outstanding for use with bread pasta and for cooking in general  love the flavor
4976,5,i have a pit bull who is a little over a year old to say he is food motivated is an understatement however with that being said he is still picky he adores these treats and others from darford i do much research before i feed treatsfood to my dog and i could not find any bad information on this company i promote these treats to familyfriends that have dogs and their dogs are also hooked good wholesome treats
4977,4,out of all the brands of bully sticks true chews has to be one of me and my dogs favorites  my favorite because they are not messy they dont break apart as easy as some of the cheaper brands and they do not smell  my pup loves it because it doesnt make him sick doesnt give him gas and gives him hoursdays of fun  their whole lineup is great and highly recommended if you have a puppydog with a sensitive tummy  fyi my pup is currently  months old and is a lb shihpoo  i gave it one less mark only because they are one of the more expensive brands and that they are a tad hard to find locally
4978,5,other pretzelshaped beef tendon were too big for toy breed but not this little one im happy to find a usa product that is nutritional and easy to chew and digest  lasts a long time  give it to her for an hour a day for  days  she likes the pretzel better than the little barbell  not smelly or greasy  also likes a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbnvegmerrick flossies dog treats  treatsa which last a long time too i try to switch up the shape of the chew bc i think it helps her teeth
4979,2,i received these in bad condition most of them were broken but the ones that werent had holes in them they were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them i would try three ladies brand they are a way higher quality
4980,4,i was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken  i wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested both suggested the same wrappers hmmm however the wrappers arrived intact  in fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage  i detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an asian market  buying in bulk saved lots of   there were a couple of wrappers  out of dozens that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them  it didnt affect the taste or function  that is the reason for  stars instead of   we werent wrapping anything that was really drippy so it wasnt a problem  we will definitely order again  shipping was rapid  a great buying experience
4981,1,i purchase banh trang spring rolls skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls but recently i got a container with black spots mixed into the skin  i tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it didnt work and had to be thrown away  at the bottom of the container  skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin  at that point i decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until i purchased a fresh batch of a different brand  when trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly i was unable locate their company webpage although there were many references to the co name bahn trang
4982,1,i bought this brand and it was just horrible amazon needs to source and offer  ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today
4983,5,these are beautiful smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads new technology so im figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well i was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but im glad i took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brandsbr br will definitely order these again
4984,3,the wrappers are good but it would have been easier if the filling was already in them  the fact that it wasnt meant i had to lookbr up what goes into a wrapper and buy water chestnuts bamboo shoots and bean sprouts to help me make up my own filling  thebr wrappers are good but more work than heating up a frozen appetizer
4985,5,im not the best cook but i like to try new things to make my diet healthier  i confess that i love ramen noodles and this product helps me cut the salt content  the flavor packet that comes in ramen noodles usually has between  grams of sodium per serving  servings in the packeti eat the whole thing so thats a lot of salt  this miso contains  grams sodium per tablespoon  i add a table spoon to my ramen then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet cutting the salt almost in half while still adding a nice savory flavor  i also add a handful of frozen peas but i like to keep it simple  im sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there so enjoy
4986,5,we are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the decafe french roast also it makes a single fresh cup at a time in our flavia coffee maker
4987,5,in my area one cannot find cinnamon mentos  i am so happy i was able to find this flavor  i just love this product
4988,5,this product is my wifes favorite  kids love it too  would suggest it if you like cinnamon  i would buy this again
4989,5,this is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange discoloration which is a sign of old green tea stay away from the big brands like lipton twinnings and bigelow they do well with black tea but not greenbr br for green tea go with this uncle lees or tazo youll never be able to go back to the others which will taste like swill from a polluted riverbr br this is real green tea and its not expensive recommendedbr br sincerelybr br rusk reeder
4990,5,dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea ive ever tasted  it never tastes stale unlike brands ive bought in grocery stores  this is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining  the metal apparently keeps out moisture
4991,5,they are awesome to snack on  they have a little kick to them but thats the best part  they help me with my cravings for sweets
4992,5,reeds crystallized ginger is the real deal its natural and basically just ginger with sugar  piece takes care of my candy cravings and aids my digestion of lunch etc
4993,2,i have one cat who cannot tolerate this particular fancy feast salmon product it is only the shredded one that gets her but get it doesbr everytime she eats it she throws it up all over everywhere my shoes the white rug and gratefully the tilebr br she ate this for several years with occasional upsets but now it is every time no more for this family i realize that this occurs on an individual basis usuallybr br but i also have one younger kitty who is at the occasional upset stage so if you have a kitty with a tender tummy i would avoid this
4994,5,try these first for all your seafood soups and stews  theyre just amazing the flavor enhances all your seafood and just makes it wonderful  plus these are great just to snack on out of the bag  kids love them  we use them for chilis soups and recipes as well  highly recommend
4995,5,if you are on the paleocavemanprimalhuntergatherer diet you will adore these cookiesbr otherwise stay away your taste buds arent attuned to the uniquely sweet natural cookies end of story paleo purchase sad standard american diet skip it
4996,2,i really wanted to like thesebr br first off these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and arent that thick and they are more like fudge that cookies look at the ingredients they are nut flour held together with honey they need some egg or something they are gooey and sticky they are extremely sweet and pack a whopping g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiberbr br im sorry i appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly they are too expensive and too nonfunctional to be a serious part of your regular diet
4997,1,i was not impressed with these cookies when i tried them when they first came out and the company had only one flavor i did not care for them but i knew that something more satisfying could be had because id tried othersbr br i have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that i love and they my friends cooking students and neighbors have really enjoyed if youre looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies i suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in the gluten free almond flour cookbook make it paleo and on elana amsterdams web site
4998,3,the cookies came sealed and seem to be high quality in there ingredients  the only thing is they just dont taste that good my girlfriend and i thought these might be a good dessertlike option while doing the paleo diet but after trying one of each kind over a couple days we just dont find ourselves going back for more  i would much rather not have a dessert and really check that box on a cheat day than being left wanting more after eating these  if you have a true gluten allergy maybe this is a good option for you but im not a believer
4999,4,these taste very good but arent like the best things ever either in order of my preference gross to good with explanation the rainforest flavor one is my least favorites i dont recommend this particular flavor has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it dont get me wrong i love cayenne but not in a cookie the tropical one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version not a bad taste really good actually the original is very great i forgot the taste though but i remember liking it alpine in my opinion is the best  it tastes like a european type of christmas cookie it has a chocolaty carob taste to it but not overlysweet
5000,5,i love these cookies i am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what i look forward too i do like the taste of the tropical one the best they all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place i expected the taste to be different and it is other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy of course notbr br when i eat them i dont even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them they dont make me crash either and feel like i ate junk food it is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients i wish i had these cookies close to me id buy them every single day
5001,5,i thought id try the multipack to see which flavor i liked the best but i like them all they are healthy fulfilling and all good ingredients i can actually pronounce these are the smaller packs and now i can proceed to ordering the larger bags love these cookies
5002,5,i just started the paleo diet and i love it lost  lbs in like a week anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank goddess theyre good i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest at first theyre good but if you read the ingredients ull see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could sooo feel it on my tong it was like an after taste but if u enjoy a little fire with ur sweet ull like rainforest flavor really wanna try the alpine flavored ones theyre a lot darker in color so it should be interesting  good job caveman bakery i love you
5003,1,ive been paleo for six months as has my partner we both found these inedible all four kinds which by the way taste nearly the samebr br im not sure what it is about them either it seems like they would be good from the ingredients but something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good i kept trying them again hoping that they would grow on me they sure didnt we finally tossed thembr br so i would advise getting just one from a local coop or something before you buy a whole bunch online i sure which i had
5004,4,i bought a  sampler pack from the caveman bakery website its not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie i like they kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars like kind or something of the ones ive tried alpine and tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it the least favorite that ive tried is either the rainforest it has a strong taste of ginger and im not a fan of ginger the other ones are pretty good too however i didnt realize that these cookies were so small but i guess based on the big portions of todays society this is a normal portionbr br overall its good would i buy again maybe if i was on a strict glutenfree diet
5005,1,formula itself is great works wonders for a baby that spits up but wtf why is it so expensive here  for  oz cans thats  for a oz can when you can buy a oz can at any store for less than  almost double the pricei dont get it
5006,5,with all of the choices of things to drink this is an excellent one it tastes great most of our choices are either loaded with sugar or carbonated  even milk is sugardense this drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol it is an excellent thirstquencher so much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade it does however acidify the ph i am supposed to be alkalizing my diet so i cant drink a lot of this br br from the time i was a small child my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health hippocrates would have been happy to discover bragg organic apple cider vinegar all natural drink concord grape acai  try it and drink to good health
5007,4,this may not be the best tasting thing i have ever drank but man do i feel instant results after drinking some i would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee i notice that my circulation feels fantastic like my whole body is warm a very healthy dose of energy and i dont notice any jitteryness like coffee or energy drinks give you  the only reason i didnt rate it  start is because a oz bottle is  which i think is a little steep but for the great feeling i get when i drink some i would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being
5008,4,let me preface this by saying i purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less i was pleasantly surprised with this drink it tastes great but definitely a little tangy what i loved about this was how great i felt after drinking it i felt awake and focused and just overall really good i will definitely be buying more
5009,2,i love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches salads etc but this drink was so vinegary that i got a bit of a tummy ache  it tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink  i tried really hard to like it but no go
5010,5,i bought this drink locally and i have to tell you they got it just right if you are like me and you like the flavor of vinegar this drink will not disappoint if you also like the flavor of grape the mixture was done perfectly no stinging taste its sort of mellow yet has that flavor of vinegar you are looking for i am highly impressed with it i went back today and bought  more bottle of it at the local coop braggs is a highly regarded apple cider vinegar so to have that kind of base to start with means alot i can pretty much promise you that you will not be disappointed if you buy it they have a couple other flavors which i will eventually try but this one has me hooked hehe 
5011,5,this is the best ever  just add hot water and mix  yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups  add some sausage and you are in heaven  yummy yum  cannot go wrong ordering this product
5012,5,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbkoumpioneer brand gravy mix country ounce packets pack of abr br i had this gravy  at the breakfast buffet in the motel in branson mobr very good the waitress told me the name so i looked it up on the internet and found it at amazon  i give it the excellent rating
5013,5,we use these for our daughter for a few reasons one they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market whole grain two they have yogurt incorporated into the bar three the are thick and do not easily crumble since our daughter starting eating them when she was about  not having to clean up after shes eaten them is a big plusbr br plus they are super yummy for adults toobr br they are more expensive than others on the market esp since i can get nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount but they are worth it makes our life easier and they dont have a ton of added sugars
5014,5,these are really excellent breakfast bars note to the previous reviewer the nutrigrain bars last i checked had artificial color in them these dont they also taste very good this is our third order through amazon great price and my daughter misses them when were out
5015,5,the flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstandingbluberry and if there is  a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick unlike this companys fig bars and pastry texturedflavored with cane  syrupnot fruit juice cal per barand low in fat and the carbs not too bad considering the great taste
5016,5,i keep a box of these in my desk at work  they make a wonderful snack or are great if i didnt have time for breakfast
5017,5,my boys have been eating these for over  years now recently the box has been redesigned i like it and its much easier to open now it used to have sharp edges and made it easy to get paper cuts it seems the recipe has changed for the bar its softer than what it used to be the boys still like it they eat only this all day long if i let them
5018,1,i bought these bars for several years at my local cooperative grocery store and ate them dailythey are tasty however the price increased nearly  during that time and i noticed that although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size the bar within the wrapper decreased when i stopped buying these the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper thats deceptive packaging so i refuse to buy these any more i suspect that other shoppers likewise complained because last month the store where i bought these stopped carrying them
5019,5,whole family likes these  tasty but not over sweet  much more healthy for you than most bars  excellentprice through amazon on the repeating order subscription
5020,3,barbaras yogurt bars are okay  i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really isnt much blueberry or for that matter apple flavors  on the positive side the bar is a soft chew  total carbs g  its an okay bar in the glut of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store
5021,5,my son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them  i love them because they have yogurt in them and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition  wish they were organic but we cant have them all  much healthier than nutragrain
5022,1,this product was a big disappointment  the picture on the box is misleading  these bars arent chunky the dough isnt flaky more like cardboardy they arent filled with pieces of fruit and if you didnt read the label which claims about  items down the ingredient list that yogurt powder is added you wouldnt have any idea you were eating yogurt at all  the bars probably contain msgs with all of the natural flavorings etc  whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a vitamin blend  theres too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition anyway  the experience is very much like eating a long thin fig bar  only not as tasty  the fig bars i buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar but also real fruit whole wheat no msgs and no trans fats id rather eat one of them i wont be purchasing this product again
5023,2,these arent as good as other bars of this type my kids wont eat them nor will my husband they are all fond of the nutrigrain variety but i thought these would be a healthier alternative
5024,4,good product good price  fast shipping  needs an insert in lid to seal container better
5025,1,looked like a good deal so i ordered the ground fennel as well as  other spices and seasonings from this company but was disappointed with them all zero flavor not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened the dill smelled like dried musty grass and the onion even worse ended up throwing them all awaysave your money do not buy this product
5026,5,i couldnt find this product in the store  i love the size and the price was just right  love the promptness of the delivery
5027,5,as an avid rice cracker fan ive tried a lot of different varieties and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes obviously some of the best are in the japanese grocery stores but at least in my case theyre out of the way most of the timebr br the crackers themselves are savory and crunchyexactly what i look for in this snack and this particular mix is nothing but crackersbr thanks to these ive stopped trying out the regular grocery store imitations
5028,5,our corgi loves all sizes shapes and flavors of dingo bone treats  the other reviewer commented on the vendor weve never got a bad dingo yet  highly recommended
5029,1,when i received this product it was old and dried out  dingo makes a good product  i buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship
5030,1,most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
5031,1,i did not even receive the correct product what i received were raw unshelled peanuts but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this i attempted to contact but got no reply do not buy from here
5032,3,a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeobccroyal oak  gourmet virginia raw in shell peanuts  pound bags pack of abr br ill appreciate your speedy deliver of my package however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell  this item is going into a gift basket for my pastor because he love raw peanuts in a shell  i dont have time to returned them for the requested product you have always been prompt with my orders in the past and i really do appreciate  this is the first time you sent me an incorrect product  ill make it work
5033,1,i would agree with the other poor ratings for royal oak  very poor customer service from royal oak we ordered this year the exact same product as last year when it arrived the nuts were not the same product and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return also they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are in season otherwise emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged
5034,5,i recommand this product my childrens  and  love it pouches as very usefull especially for breaksbr to choose enjoy
5035,5,ive tried many different brands of virginia peanuts but these are far and away the best ive turned my entire family on to this brand and theyve ordered them also theyre superb
5036,5,first of all there are two kinds of paprika  sweet and hot  both are delicious but the szeged sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind which is also awesome i have been using this spice for years and the hungarian type is consistently better than any other typebrand  use this on meat veggies cassaroles salad baked bries quiches egg dishes shrimp pretty much anything  i use this in soup all winter long especially with gulyas levas this is a traditional hungarian soup though it is often confused with goulash and czipetkebr br this product is the large restaurant size which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love its versatility
5037,5,i was so pleased with this purchase a great value since i got them on a monthly sale i love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes always a joy to have a good crunch in some recipes one of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick then i dip them in a apricot ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp my family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening although they do stay fresh in the frig for a while
5038,5,not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita  also try their agava simple syrup  love it
5039,5,i adore using this very vanilla bean paste especially for my cream pies and ice cream why its like adding a touch of heaven but without any of the bother of scraping out vanilla bean pods the flavor is also better to my liking too than vanilla beans the price is way way better too and its stores fabulously on the shelf for agesbr br for combined shipping be sure to get their sweet dough flavoring and powdered vanilla too youll be glad you didbr br for more cooking tips  techniques google my name sharonanne
5040,5,enfamil premium lipil formula is the same as the previous flagship mead johnson formulaenfamil lipilexcept that it has prebiotics added in  our son was on enfamil lipil from september september   he was breastfed and formula fed during this time  our daughter who is due in january  will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life  we tried two other formulas with our sonsimilac advance and parents choice  the similac was fine but clumped badly  during the time we experimented with the parents choice formula my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu  i think the parents choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again  i believe that mead johnsons decision to use prebiotics is a good one  our son had colicacid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins  he was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little culturelle a probiotic in his formula in the evening  and since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract he had fewer sick days after introducing the culturelle  probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quickerbr br regarding the bpa found in formula can liners i talked to an enfamil customer service representative who told me that mead johnson now uses cans that are lined with a modified polyester that is bpa free  similac advance earlyshield comes in a bpafree can also the simplepac containerbr br another concern parents have is the cost of formula  name brand formulas are expensive  but if you think about it you are feeding a human being for about  a week a can usually lasts us  to  weeks   a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours  and with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product availablebill gates couldnt buy a better formula than whats on the shelves at target or walmartbr br if you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store as i was in september  i suggest starting with the flagship formula of either mead johnson enfamil premium lipil abbott laboratories similac advance earlyshield or nestle good start gentle plus or good start protect plus  they are all excellent infant formulas  you just have to see what works for you and your baby
5041,4,i wish i found the plastic refill packs instead of  giant metal cans  seems like a lot of wasted packaging  i just didnt know to look for them until much later  but its much cheaper from amazon than the gocery store  probably about the same price as costco but no tax here and super convenient and the formula mixes well my kid loves it and most importantly his poops seem normalnot nasty formula poops if you know what i mean
5042,4,alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much
5043,5,no gas for baby no extra bubbles when you shake it in warm or cold water mixes perfectly without much time this is easy  my kid was happy swapping from breast milk to this with no hesitation when my milk dried up at mths
5044,5,we had to move to formula when our baby was  weeks we have found enfamil premium to mix easier than the regular enfamil lipil our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula i love getting it in bulk from amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula the price with free shipping is comparable with local grocery stores in the austin area
5045,5,our baby loves it and amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal thanks amazon
5046,5,i read other reviews before buying and they are not encoraging but still for some reasons i got  to buy to use my amazon gift card  but then i am very happy with the purchase delivery is prompt quantity is correct  over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop
5047,1,go to costco and you can buy lower than this  price per oz currently   off regular  tax for big size  ozbr br besides it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formulabr br be careful many times some sellers over price a product and still make the product rank in the best sellers
5048,1,be careful when odering this because they say its a  pk but you will only get a  pk plus the formula goes out in  months  so if you did like i did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck  so i know i will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren because they wont be able to eat it
5049,1,if one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk then sugar diabetic maker then milk again the fourth ingredient is sunflower oil fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin with the seventh ingredient being get this tuna fish oil they even feature vitamin d which is animal derived there are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure if we really think about what we are feeding our babies would we use this product i know i wouldnt know your food sources
5050,5,have tried a few different peanut brittles from amazon and this is by far the best it is loaded with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage
5051,1,these were rancid upon receipt  terrible  very little sugar if any used  something went wrong with these as i cant believe anyone would see this as a final product  both cans
5052,3,i like that these are organic and dont have corn syrup  my kids and i both like them  id give them  stars but i noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe  the crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily  and if you have kids under  you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be  the taste is still great but i preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them  and when you order these in the mail like i did last time dont expect many full graham cracker sheets  most are already broken in two and quite a few are broken at the edges as well
5053,5,i have been buying  new morning graham crackers since february of  never had a problem with damage of the crackers in shipping br why did amazon remove the graham crackers from subscribe and save  why did amazon remove the graham crackers from prime the crackers are a much higher price from a third party seller i will purchase the crackers from whole foods  not fair of amazon to take away the connivence of ordering a case
5054,5,my husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar and they taste great
5055,4,i rarely want to eat much when i first arise in the morning but i do have coffee  ive found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee  they are graham crackers  not anything superduper amazing  but they are nice cinnamony graham crackers that are organic
5056,5,my children will only eat healthy products and they love these graham crackers  i am so glad that they are available through amazon
5057,3,these crackers are terrific and they are priced right  however i ordered them on  and the expiration date on the box was   we have only eaten four boxes  they still taste fine after the expiration date but am i really expected to consume  boxes in  months
5058,5,these are very good they were a great price and fastfree shipping when you purchase enough food  the only thing is that the box was smaller than i guessed it would be
5059,5,i was quite surprised to find that sociables were available thru amazon i cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought i would have to give them upbr they arrived quickly in great condition and we now are on regular shipments of them
5060,1,i felt ripped off the photo clearly shows two bones and the price at  plus is indicative of two i thought i was purchasing a bone packaged as two to a pack walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for  ea why doesnt the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one it wasnt worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so i am doing it here  beartoothjoe
5061,5,wow i heard of this candy but could never find it now i am hooked now i dont have to suck on child lemons with salt just shakey shakey
5062,5,i absolutely love these seven of these sweet very thin graham crisps are only  calories but its easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost  in the package delicious by themselves wonderful with ice cream if they are purchased using amazons addon program there is no shipping chargebr br update  ive seen mixed reviews of this companys products the items ive purchased have not been stale or strange smelling
5063,4,i love the  degree cracked peppercorn wheat and other varieties so i thought i would try the caramel cinnamon and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers true  you can have a lot of these crackers for little caloriescarbs but the flavor is bland in terms of satisfaction they dont quite cut it for me as a snack unless i put peanut butter or something on them they would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter along with some peanut butter fruit spread honey or cream cheese
5064,1,is that these are  calories per serving however in all honesty i didnt make it through a full servingbr br i was excited about these they looked like a grown up graham crackerbr br first problem was the smell they smelled like melted plastic and something else id hesitate to even guess what it is but its bad i bravely pulled out one small crisp hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the  aroma it was not the crisp itself smells horrificbr i figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelledbr second problem is that i was very very wrong about that they have a funky chemical taste that just defies description the aftertaste is sort of like a skunkychewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the washwet cardboard kinda taste seriously it was awfulbr br i tasted these about  minutes ago and after drinking an entire bottle of water and brushing my teeth i can still taste itbr br im glad these were an addon but they are still absolutely terrible their only redeeming quality is that they are cute not one single member of my family will actually eat them though so this was definitely a waste of  had i known they would be this awful id have just got a second bag of a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbpoahi im skinny sticks sweet onion multigrain ounceabr only  cent more than these but miles better in taste
5065,5,this soup is good i really love this brand of soupsmy favorite being the chicken and dumplings healthy choice isnt always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups i love them they taste homemade and amazingly better than campbells or progresso i recommend this the chicken and dumplings the split pea and hamin fact every variety ive tried has been delicious you cant really go wrong with this
5066,5,first i agree with j bishops houston tx reviewbr br this is not only the best flavor of the healthy choice soup line it is clearly among the best canned soup flavors of all timebr br healthy choice is the only brand of canned soup i buy on any regular basis  its the only brand that has never used msga sure sign that a recipe lacks imagination not too mention sodium issuesbr br i really wish i could buy quantities of this in the microwave packaging hard to find in stores a lifetime supply would do nicely
5067,3,if you love vegetable soup you should like this yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it toobr but it was not as good as i expected or hoped it would be
5068,3,i enjoyed this soup  it was flavorful with a nice blend of spices  i will buy it again
5069,1,tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and i like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties although i didnt expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup i did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups i have tried that is a light broth with a mix of vegetables corn beans chicken and mexican spices this soup is thick  really thick like the thickest tomato soup youve ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich its also sweet and does not taste in the least like a mexican soup instead imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables beans and some chicken thrown inbr br i ended up giving it all away and to be fair one of the people i gave the soup to said her husband really liked itbr br for a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup try a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeubicampbells select mexican chicken tortilla ounce cans pack of a
5070,5,first off there is a difference when you drink something out of box versus glass a big differencebr br i was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle i snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blinkbr br i had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago only to find out when i got home that they didnt sell the canned version at my store i was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff onlinebr br i have tried the other brands this is by far the best it could be because its in a glass im not a high end taste tester but i just know there is a big difference and this stuff is like winebest served when chilled so being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled ill always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck im a foodie i love savoring food and beveragebr br a lot of people are mentioning its over priced compared to what and if you notice its not amazon selling it its a distributor using amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it the free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case they could reduce the price but then it would probably say  for shipping it really would not make a differencebr br but im happy its at my local health food store im not ready to buy this by the case woohoo thanks taste nirvana this really is happiness in a bottle go get your own im not sharing 
5071,5,this brand is a little hard to find in stores as i dont think its carried by any of the major supermarket chains i discovered it at au bon pain and noticed that unlike other brands ive tried this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added its just pure unadultered coconut water so the quality cant get much better the other thing i really like about it is that its a glass container rather than paper or plastic so the taste is not compromised these things alone are worth  stars to me but there are a couple things i would suggest to make it even better first this isnt really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where theres pulverized very small drinkable pieces floating in the liquid these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking to me this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh youd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink second  ounces doesnt go a long way id like to see it bumped up to at least a oz id then feel like im getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better
5072,5,if you like coconut water then you will love taste nirvana it has bits of coconut in it not just a few it has a lot of little bits
5073,5,this is great coconut water and there is no added sugar its all natural and they use ripe coconut not young coconut
5074,4,pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut  id like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the natural coconut water means  the tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage  the fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy but its still tasty
5075,4,as far as taste goes this is the best coconut water ive tasted i have not tried all the other brands so i am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants which i think is usually sweetened so it really isnt a fair comparison vitacoco and amy and brians vitacoco uses brazilian coconuts while taste nirvana and amy and brians use thai coconuts it seems like taste nirvana and amy and brians are naturally sweeter than vitacoco with taste nirvana being the sweetest this is a good sweet though since all of these three brands have no sugars added while ive liked all the coconut water ive tasted vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste while taste nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness i liked the pulp as well although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps im used to at some restaurantsbr br the only reason i took a star off is due to the price these  oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy taste nirvana in fact at the current price this costs as much as i paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles for the best bargain on this brand buy a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbowgtaste nirvana real coconut water with pulp ounce pack of abr br i wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say taste nirvana or amy and brians taste the best and id have to give my vote to taste nirvana hopefully some day i will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote but if youre like me and dont have any coconut trees nearby try this out enjoy
5076,5,this is my favorite coconut water having traveled in asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete nothing i found in the store came close until i found taste nirvana the other brands are mostly from brazilian coconuts whereas this brand uses thailand coconuts and it makes a difference  truly happiness in a bottle its a little pricey but i cant get enough
5077,4,i had coconut trees growing in my backyard in southeast asia and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp is the closest to the real thing that ive found
5078,5,imho there is simply not a better beverage on earth since i need to add  some more words see prior sentence
5079,1,coconut water should not be sweetened actually no sugar should ever be added sweeting things is an american custom which ruins the real flavor of coconut water i lived in jamaica for  years and the bahamas for  and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar its naturalbr i will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that its more natural and unaltered these boxed caned and packaged coconut water are nasty i am still yet to try a brand one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it
5080,5,this will ruin supermarket mustard for you high quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through
5081,5,i have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy but fall short  this spreads easy and is neither too thick nor too thin  it actually does have enough heat to taste without being excessive  this mustard would make a great addition to any sauces marinades salad dressings or just for dipping  i would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat
5082,5,a very tasty little cake the cake was surprisingly moist and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering well definitely be buying this product again
5083,5,the cake was a little smaller than i thought but it was delicious  my husband and i enjoyed it so much we are ordering more for christmas
5084,5,this tea actually tastes the way a rose smells  its like sipping on roses when you drink it  im glad it can be purchased on amazon because i looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores like trader joes that carry unusual food items and could not find it
5085,1,it says habenero peppers on the ingredients but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle smells like molasses and soy sauce taste like molasses and soy sauce absolutely boring
5086,5,great sauce used in many jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning most use walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice
5087,1,tastes too sweet which jerk seasoning is not  walkers woods is the most authentic to taste  this was a waste
5088,2,i thought i would try this but i am sticking with my uncle joes jerk sauce this is sweet  not hotshould be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label
5089,4,received order within  business days  the product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same  also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured which we had bought previously locally  i suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product but also the recipe  the distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past  thanks for another great distributor for the products we likea hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeozfqworld harbors jamican style jerk sauce ounce bottle pack of a
5090,5,i love this sauce it is sweet and molassesy with a tiny kick of heat  i use it to make hawaiian chicken or pork all the time  ive never had authentic jamaican jerk so i cant vouch for accuracy there but my whole family loves this one d
5091,5,i love this sauce i used to get it at my local grocery store but theyve stopped selling it i just ordered a six pack and its going to last a good long while most people i know that have tried this dont like it but i find the taste sweet and kind of zippy at the same time i have been trying to find a substitute for months im so glad i found this on amazon 
5092,5,we used to buy this sauce at our local grocery store which closed in september  luckily we were able to find it at amazon  you do have to buy a pack but the expiration date is march   habanero peppers give it a kick even though it has no onions  im allergic to onions so this is a welcome product  very hard to find any good sauce with no onions
5093,5,this sauce has just the right combination of sweet spicy and mild heat that is perfect for using with a family  the spicy isnt overpowered with allspice the way some other brands are  baste this on grilled pineapple for jerk turkey burgers and youll be in love too  my only trouble is finding it in our small town stores have had to go to the internet but its worth it
5094,1,first of all somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay anybr attention to those no votes they both arrived within minutes of posting this reviewbr br this sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is not jerk sauce doesnt even remotelybr resemble a bad facsimile i dont know what world harbors is thinking cause this stuffbr is horriblebr br btw i like their teriyaki sauce but this its as bad as it gets
5095,4,its not great plain but its wonderful mixed with other herbs  it can be a little bland if you dont put anything but the rosehips in the infuser  hibiscus goes great with it though  its a great tea for children because its mild and fruity for adults add it to something elsebr also you can eat the rosehips after theyve been brewed sounds weird but they are great they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin c  watch out for the pith thats the best word i can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds though if you decide to eat the hips  every once in a while you find one that hasnt been depithed properly hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips
5096,5,these cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent i use them in cooking i let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for massage oil and also mix it straight into beeswax for candles it works well on all counts i am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed
5097,4,this mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday  its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipes  when you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity this can fill the bill quickly and easily  it has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks  i highly recommend it
5098,5,when i opened the package i expect the same old tasting beef jerky but my taste buds surprised me  this beef jerky tastes amazing ive been buying products from amazoncom for years was really inspired to leave any feedback but as soon as i tasted this beef jerky i wanted everyone to know  i just ordered  more br br  baba ali
5099,5,this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted also the company truly gives an orthodox muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other muslim companys who try do deceive the consumer
5100,5,i am not muslim but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of sweet jerky out there  it has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor spicybut not hot  it is easy to chew and doesnt leave your fingers sticky i wish it came in more economical sizes   or  oz sizes but that doesnt seem to be the case  its a great jerky and might just be addictive which probably makes the  ounces bag size a good choiceafter the first  ounces you have to stop at least long enough to open another bag
5101,5,well after trying a lot of brands this is probably the best beef jerky i ever tasted
5102,5,great product and it tastes great  i keep a bag in my drawer at work in case i get hungry and its great to eat to keep my protein count high since im working out
5103,2,these are very tasty but way too sweet  sugary  i felt like i was eating candy instead of meat  if thats okay with you then youll probably love these but i was looking for something a bit healthier  yes i know it says sweet in the product name but i bought it because of the no hormone no antibiotic no artificial ingredient aspect
5104,5,never had jerky before because ive never seen a halal version was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive went through a whole bag in one sitting i recommend all my curious muslim brothers and sisters to try it
5105,5,amazing taste incredible quality this is the best beef jerky i have ever had i think its even better than the other nonhalal ones this beef jerky made me leave my first review ever on amazon though im a regular costumer of theirs thumbs up
5106,4,i dont eat chips often but when i do these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on some chips seem to have barely any flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more that just a hint of lime
5107,5,product arrived on time nicely packaged and gift wrapped the treats were all quality and very good  nice keepsake box
5108,5,i got these for my mom who is always sucking on a cough drop these are gummi and are minty like a cough drop she really likes them a unique gummi creation
5109,5,this oil is wonderful ive had almond oil that was so strong it overwhelmed what i was using it for salad cooking  i loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more
5110,2,i wanted to love this because i love earl grey tea i need decaf and i adore the convenience of the keurig  unfortunately i dont love these  the flavor is very weak and doesnt deliver on the aroma  i typically use the large cup setting on the size model but even the small cup is wimpy with these  i did find that mixing this one with a strongerflavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength but then you have to make  cups of something the english breakfast decaf is a much better choice
5111,5,as someone who goes through lots of thyme i use it in everything except cereal i was pleasantly surprised to see this product on amazon at a very reasonable price looks smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe  weeks in my house 
5112,5,good product and reasonable price compared with local store for people who use it everyday its a great deal i would recommend it to everyone who loves thyme flavor
5113,4,i have purchased several herbs from frontier which have been of good quality  thyme leaf is always one of the most difficult to purchase due to the likely chance of recieving more stem than leaf  this thyme leaf purchase was of average to good quality  i did have about  stem to leaf cut in the package so i was satified with the selection  when i dry my own thyme leaf i usually do about the same or a little less stem to leaf ratio for cooking use  stem of the thyme leaf are just as favorable as the leaf and can be used to cook with successfully
5114,5,i was reading a news story about how lab research suggest a thyme tincture to be one of the most effective ways to fight acne better than a prescription i got  quart jars this amount is perfect for that many  cheap bottles of vodka  proof filled each jar half way with thyme then topped it off with the vodka im still letting it sit it takes six weeks before it will be complete where i will then have to get cheese cloth and separate the thyme from the liquid and do a test run ill update with results midmay
5115,5,i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price  frontier met that discription
5116,5,this is the best olive oil not for cooking as any olive oil will work the flavor and aroma is fantastic brings you to italy use on salads breads for dipping
5117,5,this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for christmas  thanks for a reliable easy shopping experience
5118,5,i brought some of this back from a trip to jamaica and wished i had bought it by the gallon  it is very hard to find but well worth ordering in bulk  it is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to jamaica with every taste  i have attempted to duplicate it many times but cant seem to get it right  i am ecstatic to finally have found a source
5119,5,i bought this on a whim and wow do i consider myself lucky  it was a shot in the dark but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces i have ever tasted  not only has some good spicy heat but excellent flavor as well  its an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet and a very robust mix of spices  one thing i really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on but does not overwhelm it  the heat is hot for sure but doesnt linger for very long  the flavor is very original  i went back to amazon and bought a whole case of it
5120,5,i love jerk cooking and this is the perfect jerk sauce to put over a freshly cooked piece of jerk chicken pork goat or beef each bottle does not last long at our house
5121,5,pamelas makes an awesome delicious easy to use wheatfree baking mix  the  lb bag is clearly a wholesale product coming in a brown paper bag without any fancy labels  in january amazon was selling this product for  which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix  now they are charging  for the exact same product which makes it more expensive than buying the same product offered as  of the  lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging  something isnt right with this product offer anymore  shame on you amazon  youre supposed to be above such schemesbr still swear by pamelas wheatfree baking  pancake mix  its the best
5122,5,pamelas all purpose mix is exactly what the gluten free folk out there need its like using regular white flour in almost everything every time i make a cookie muffin pancake baked good white sauce etc it always turns out amazing i have been using this product for at least  years i only went gluten free about  years ago but i used pamelas products before going gf because i liked the taste of them
5123,5,i love pamelas baking mix  the  lb bag is quite large and the expiration is march   only  months after my purchase i will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time  not worth it
5124,5,what can i say about this flour that wont make it look like i was paid to say it  i have been using this flour since i was diagnosed with celiac disease six years ago i have worked as a gluten free lifestyle coach for gf diagnosed people for years helping them to adjust to the diet and pamelas flour is one of the first things i steer them to  it is a great allaround gluten free flour  it is not too light like rice flour and not too heavy like a bean flour  it does substitute well in all of my recipes  its baking outcome is very desireable  i have never had trouble with it in fact many times the comments i get on my baked goods from my nongf friends is that they cant tell its gluten freebr br now to  be fair i need to mention that it does have dairy and nuts in it  this is a problem for dairy and nut allergy persons and children  this is the only drawback i see in this product  unfortunately i have not found something that i like as well to substitute for it
5125,5,i am so excited about this product  i have made paula deans apple cake half of the glaze pancakes thanksgiving dressing muffins and cornbread using this gf baking mix in place of the plain flour salt and baking powder  they were excellent  my non gf family enjoyed them tremendously  the finished products were not gravely or grainy the taste was greatbr br if you have never tried this test it out in the much smaller size  it is wonderful
5126,5,i have a cafe in talent  oregon  i couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere this is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days  my supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take  weeks thanks amazon
5127,5,you can exchange this baking mix for regular flour in almost any recipe  also makes yummy pancakes and waffles
5128,5,my wife has celiac sprue which is a allergy to gluten in certain grains she was diagnosed with this disease about  years ago when she was first diagnosed we could only purchase gluten free products from health food stores and it was very expensive as awareness about this disease has spread more companies are offering gluten free products in our search we stumbled across pamelas my wife fell instantly in love with it the pancakes made from this flour are indistinguishable from wheat flour we made the jump and now the whole family is eating pamelas to purchase it at the store is rather expensive did a web search and found it reasonably priced at amazon we will continue to purchase pamelas in bulk until it is no longer offered great pancakes
5129,5,growing up with wheat i had an aversion to gluten free gf products but when my daughter exhibited sensitivities to gluten we thought wed give this a try  both my wife and i were amazed at the waffles  i typically made waffles from scratch but using this mix also saves a lot of time  just add eggs water  oil  the subscribe and save pound bag is the best value with free shipping we will store unused product sealed in the freezer
5130,5,i keep pamelas baking mix in a  gallon container with a spinon bucket seal lid in the pantrybr br when i want to make pancakes or waffles to start the day right i take a cup or two of mix add a teaspoon of vanilla extract an egg and olive oil and im ready to go  what i enjoy most about purchasing the  lb bag is that it is easy to store and keeps fresh for months yet is accessible and consistent in performancebr br for a special treat i like to add hemp seed on the top of the waffles during cooking and fresh blueberries and strawberries before topping off with agave syrup
5131,5,this is our second time purchasing the lb bag of pamelas pancake and baking mix  last time it came with a label with baking instructions but this time it didnt  good thing i had cut off my label and put it in the bucket with the pancake mix  but other than that this mix couldnt be more perfectbr since being diagnosed celiac and trying to balance gluten freegluten eating in the same kitchen with  people we opted to move everyone gluten free at home  this mix is a godsend and seriously it tastes remarkable  it is a real time saver and what we do instead of drive thru windows these days  i make a bunch and keep them in the freezer so they can be pulled out toasted and made into a quick pbj for the kids  i am so grateful to be able to purchase this is bulk as it makes gf eating much easier for our above average family size and keeps my kitchen gf
5132,5,we use this flour for pancakes muffins biscuits and more  i have found that this mix works great in all my old regular bisquick recipes  we find the flavor to be similar to wheat flour  we have subbed this flour into several wheat flour cookie recipes leaving out the leavening called for and only one has turned out unsatisfactorily but not inedible  definitely convenient and more affordable to our family of seven to be able to purchase in bulk
5133,5,we go through pamelas like crazy  fantastic for pancakes we like to add a little vanilla to batter  it also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread  the  lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise
5134,5,my family and i are relatively new to gluten free and we have been in search of a baking mix to replace our weekend breakfasts  we have tried several others and they all taste gluten free if you know what i mean  pamelas however is so good and you cant tell its gluten free try it you wont regret it
5135,5,this is exactly what i wanted it is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store thank you so much im new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect
5136,5,the product arrived undamaged just as it was described on the website no delays and arrived quickly the customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order
5137,5,when you have health issues taking gluten out of your diet is a good way to start it may be the source of your problem it has been in my case and using pamelas products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better
5138,5,whats not to like about pamelas baking mix i use it as a base for a number of baked goods i have made biscotti  and a wonderful lemon ricotta cake with pamelas  to name just a  couple of thingsbr br i got a little carried away with the last purchase  i bought the  pound bag which means i wont have to order it again for a yearbr br for those that area curious about the pamelas baking mix  its a wonderful tasty base mix the waffles and pancakes it makes are delightful  i really cannot say another bad about the baking mix nor amazon for bringing the larger bag option to us  the consumer
5139,5,ive tried tons of gf pancake mixes  i could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again  these are so moist and delicious  my  year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease  she loves them too  my wife and children who are not gf also love thembr m
5140,5,its hard to find quality gf products and pamelas doesnt dissapoint i always recommend this i go through a lot of this blend with a family of five amazon helps keep it more affordable the pancakes are great and the waffles are really good i havent tried it with much else yet but my sisterinlaw does chocolate scones  frequently  with great raves i use the bread mix also all the time and am very pleased with both
5141,5,i started eating these after reading esselstyns popular book on heart disease heal through eating oatmeal  theres no way i can choke down cooked oat meal eating oatmeal cookies on the other hand is something i can swallow  all of erin bakers cookies appear to be made with oatmeal and the three that ive tried are palatable enough  nevertheless the fruit  nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that i most looked forward to savoring each morning i hope it wasnt because of lower oatmeal content than the other threebr br in short you dont have to be the cookie monster to like these nor do youdespite the fruit  nut flavorhave to be a little fruity to quote norman bates audible thoughts in hitchcocks psycho or a health nut to find these tasty and nutritiousmaybe even therapeutic dr esselstyn would seem to think so and the advantage of the mini size is that you might feel betterless guilty at leastabout knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time
5142,4,i like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee  they are also great for those mornings you really arent in the mood for breakfast but know youll be hungry later  they seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two  they do taste great  not too sweet and not overly cakelike  buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more
5143,4,if you want a quick pick me up in a small package each one individually wrapped this is my choice i have one in the car mid compartment and in my briefcase they would be great and a pre aerobic workout snack great flavor moist  not too sweet beware if you are allergic to nutsthese are out i took them out of the box and divided into zip lock bags and froze when i needed more i just pulled one bag from the freezer and it worked out great
5144,5,breakfast cookies are a favorite with the young children ages  and  of a friend  these oneounce cookies are the right size for young children  the are individually wrapped and can be used at home or as a take along snack item  they can also be used as special treats on occasions like halloween
5145,5,erin bakers products are a favorite for my family  the breakfast cookie minis are great for snacks  coffee breaks and especially good for travelingbr this is a denser product than a regular cookie nice and chewy and filling with only  calories
5146,4,my kids yrs and  yrs love these cookies much to my surprise  the mini ones are just right for them and im happy to give them cookies for breakfast  there are  things i dont like   the individual cookie packages are very hard to openi always need scissors and  the cookies fallapart easilyi wouldnt recommend passing these out in the carbr overall a great product and i purchased these in bulk so we are sure to always have them on hand
5147,5,we love erin bakers breakfast cookiesbr br that said the small minis are the first time that we have had a problem problem with about  of them being moldy or having mold on thembr br storage has not been an issue  when we got them within  an hour they were placed into the freezer until use  as we use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave for a quick warmup  however still i am fearful each time i rip into a small package that i will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookiebr br this is obviously not conducive to enjoyment while eating thembr br we have never had this problem with any of the the big cookie varietybr br update     today i opened my door to find a box sent to me from erin bakers and it had  boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis the exact amount that i had found to be moldy in my original order  amazing company  check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about  top marks to this company  not only fabulous breakfast cookies but amazing customer service which they volunteered  i did not ask for
5148,3,these are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea coffee or milk  but they are very dry if eaten plain  i do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be  i am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies and of the regular size eb cookies but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty  i think the double choc cherry tastes better than these  happy to have them for last resort snackonthego needs but not my favorite
5149,5,i was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies  it is soft a little chewy and yummy  very tasty
5150,5,these are excellent they taste great and are just the right size  two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you  the larger size breakfast cookies are just too big  of these are perfect  my husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast too much trouble but since i bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door
5151,5,i love these cookies and i love erin as a result these cookies make me smile the texture makes my eyes googly the smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome itd be to spend them with erin have her bring the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor swing listening to the birds and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyardbr br the only thing is that this kind and the other kind raisin dont differ much in taste they both taste the sametaste of heaven
5152,5,i live in the area where these cookies are made and i remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago  each one was wrapped in saran wrap and had a handwritten label on them  the packaging has changed and there are many different flavors available now but the original breakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones didbr br the smaller size is great for a snack as the large ones are enough for two people  full of good stuff not too sweetits a treat that you can feel good about
5153,5,erin bakers organic breakfast cookies are delicious and moist i am truley enjoying them  each cookie is individually packaged there great for throwing in your lunch work school or driving on a trip although she makes different kinds i find the fruit  nut is a favorite so if you like a oatmeal cookie thats wholesome deliicous  moist then this is the one its a winner
5154,5,of the erin baker products the fruit  nut mini breakfast cookie is my favorite  i have one mini breakfast cookie about  calories with a cup of coffee in the morning and i feel satisfied and ready to start the day  very healthy low in caloreis and super delicious is what makes the product work for me  try it youll like it
5155,4,if you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else  but if you are looking for a fairly good tasting  calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good
5156,2,my kids love these and weve ordered them often  but as was the case with at least one other reviewer this batch came in with some mold i freeze them as soon as they arrive so had the have been moldy upon arrivalbr br too bad  but at this price wont run the risk of having to toss out product
5157,5,ive been having these cookies for about  years and l love it but  i can not find them in the store where i used to buy i live in san diego so i would like to buy them here thaks
5158,3,i started out thinking they were ok a little more substance than the breakfast bar from whole foods  but after i ordered a pack i didnt realize it was  boxes of  and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as i was flying out the door i realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry
5159,5,if you want to treat your tastebuds to the ultimate delight try dulce de leche and this brand is the best as a native of argentina i grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close serve it inside crepes slightly warm folded and with powder sugar with flan or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way very sweet
5160,5,a friend brought me this from argentina and my kids and i ate it with a spoon and then apples so that i would feel less guilty when we finished i immediately panicked because i wasnt sure if i could get it here in the us low and behold i found it on amazon it is different packaging but same company so i assume it is just catering to americans delicious
5161,5,i think this is the best dulce de leche i ever tried  i discovered at the llao llao hotel in bariloche argentina on a recent trip  they serve it at breakfast there
5162,5,just an outstanding productbr br an authentic dulce de leche ranked numberone in argentina for its exceptional richness and depth of flavorbr br made at a small dairy outside of buenos airesbr br note that the web page or supplier indicates made in spain but this product is clearly made in argentina
5163,5,i was born in argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche to eat with toasts or as addon to cakes comparable to chimbotebr br note i noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste so unless you grew up eating it you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet
5164,5,my father grew up in argentina and since he came to the states has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood he doesnt have to search anymore i bought him a couple of jars this past christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since
5165,5,we used to have a pipeline to get homemade dulce de leche from a bonafide argentine but alas said pipeline moved away  this is the next best thing and doesnt involve me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk caramelizes
5166,5,i am so glad i ordered this it is the best dulce de leche i have been able to find i had read about this somewhere and am now convinced that many people are not familiar with this product if you like anything caramel youll love this
5167,5,very high quality dulce de leche from argentina compared to most brands its a bit lighter colored and the taste is more subdued and milkier you may or may not appreciate this as its not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche but its by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make for this id give it  stars if i could
5168,5,i bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it  now it seems assumed i will keep her in stock  that alludes to a completely different product review  the point is buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home  it seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least  my only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers  my gf usually gets what she wants
5169,5,this is a good quality product which definitely helps tame my tummy  i have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how i feel  definitely recommended along with heathers acacia fiber which is lifechanging
5170,5,i wasnt much of a tea drinker until i bought a breville automatic tea maker and a bag of tummy tea fennel for my wife she started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great a little like licorice we both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since this is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over it is a feeling you do not forget  if i was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be itbr br   for those who enjoy drinking tea i would encourage you to look into the breville tea maker produced by a german firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea the price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny
5171,5,i love tea hot or cold and am always looking to try new ones this tea brews up a wonderful cup  just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy the smell alone is captivating i tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately it really does taste just like good quality licorice and its naturally sweet when my urge for sweets hits i can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings this tea will be a staple in my pantry
5172,5,i think this is a really good deal i seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew good stuff
5173,4,live with digestive problems and you eat a lot of mint mint lozenges mint tea and those curiously strong mints  you can get tired of the taste of mint  especially in the morning  i gave up coffee months ago and i still whimper some mornings so im looking for some kind of substitute  forget decaf anything  forget chocolate  forget tea  some people swear by hot water with lemon i dont too acid  this fennel tea sells elsewhere as tummy tamer tea it does  its better than chamomile tea which doesnt do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anythingbr br ive used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in  when even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much this goes down nicely  but if youre not a fan of vegetable soup or celery this might take a little getting used to me i like it the smell reminds me of hops
5174,5,the fennel smells fresh tastes good and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends it is packaged exactly as shown in the picture came in a timely manner thanks
5175,5,i love gummy bears love i also love to eat healthy and for me that means avoiding corn syrup whenever possible i was sent these gummy bears by accident when i ordered the sour gummy bears also by surf sweets and i am glad i was as these are absolutely delicious they have the same texture as regular gummy bears though if you let them warm up a little bit or get an off batch they may be a little bit chewier  some find them a little bit sweeter than regular gummy bears but i think that is due to the lack of corn syrup i dont really notice any difference note that these do still contain gelatin so vegans should not eat this i think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for vegans the natural fruit juice flavors are delicious and the fact that you get your vitamin c as well is just an added bonus i would definitely recommend these though i suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one gobr br one last caveat  if you are on a budget i suggest you go with the surf sweets sour gummy bears also available on amazon as they are ten dollars cheaper im still unsure of the reason for the price difference but if youre on a budget the other ones are great too
5176,5,these are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids br like regular gummy bears but even better  with extra flavorbr perfect consistencynot too chewy great all the way around
5177,5,my four kids love these its great that theres zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store fruit ie total chemical junk snacks a safe kid snack
5178,5,these are always delicious  a much healthier alternative to most candies kids sugary snacks the size is perfect for goodie bags  even fits in large easter eggs
5179,5,i found these little awesomely delicious fruit snacks at a gluten free show in wisconsinthe guy that was there offered me a package and i fell in lovethey are organic which makes them all the more cool and they are very very tastyi looked on the ingredients and was surprised to find no high fructose corn syruptheyre a little chewy at first but i can not find anything else wrong with them they are a wonderful fruit snack that i dont feel guilty about eating afterwards
5180,5,my  month old grandson only eats organic foods and i was looking for a treat to give him when he visits he loves these candies and i dont feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one they stay at grandmas and grandpas house of course we brush his teeth afterwards
5181,5,you cant go wrong with rosa monte especial this is one of the best yerbas in argentina go for it seller did everything ok in time and etc
5182,5,i switched to mate from coffee a few years ago i know its generally an afternoon drink but i drink it in the morning like coffee there were a couple of websites where i bought it regularly unfortunately dr oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea and the price went up everywhere including my regular sellers so i went looking and found this on amazonbr br this is my favorite brand the seleccioacuten especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in this is elaborada con palo meaning that it has stem bits in it which makes the flavor last longer for more refills some will prefer sin palowithout stems because the stems also add a little bitterness to the matebr br i understand that in argentina where mate is a common as coffee is here rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brandsbr br of this seller in particular i can say that they were prompt and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate a lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds especially either citron which is lemon or hierbes de montantildea which means moutain herbs and tastes like mintbr br i however prefer this for daytoday consumption i run plain water through the coffeemaker fill a large coffee cup about  full with mate and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as i sip it through the bombillabr br the main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what i had been getting from my previous suppliers the difference is probably about handling and storage the bags are like a bag of sugar and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside creating dust in the mate dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue tastes a little bitter and generally degrades the experiencebr br when it first arrived i opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that i use to store it and i immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what i had been getting when i ordered this from my old sellerbr br im very happy with what i received
5183,4,packages came in soft container that had been crushed and one was split open  i was worried about how fresh it would be but its aged so no worries  the mate is flavorful and strong  i dont have much to compare it too but at  for  kilos  lbs it seems to be a fantastic deal with a a good productbr br not organic kind of a bummer but pretty much expected  i would get this again but i will probably try another more expensive organic version and see if i can taste any difference
5184,5,rosamonte especial can never let you down tastes fresh and strong i smell argentina in every sip yerba mate is going through an increase in prices almost doublecrazy but its worth the value i will never change rosamonte especial
5185,4,if youre setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can you can then pop the top of the can releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon
5186,5,ive been feeding wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my  cats i believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy happy cats and reduced vet bills but still the cost of wellness has been prohibitive i was excited to see felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans and for a much lower price so i am trying it just switched them over this week so far so good the bowls have been licked clean and while i questioned the whole peas when i saw them they werent left in the bowl the ingredients and quality of the felidae seems comparable to the wellness so unless i find information indicating otherwise and ive been looking i think well stick with felidae
5187,3,ive been on the hunt for high quality yet affordable cat food for my little ones the past few months i decided to order a case of felidae along with a case of a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvkbwpet guard fish chicken  liver food for catsa well they love the petguard but absolutely hate the felidae all three of them sniffedlicked it and looked at me like youre kiddingright even mixing in some of their old food and gradually trying to change them over wouldnt work theyd sniff it and walk offbr br they love the petguard though and will inhale it the second i put it on their plates so at least i discovered one good food theyll eat i guess ill donate the  cans of felidae i have left to the local shelter despite the fact my cats wouldnt eat it i still gave it  stars because it is a great quality foodif your cats will eat it
5188,5,i have  house cats  one was recently diagnosed with diabetes  we got his diabetes under control with insulin but i began researching diet information to help us  all of my research led us to try felidae grain free  i spent two weeks carefully switching louis and the four girls from dry iams to felidae  i was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time i had him totally on felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally  all with our veterinarians supervision a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts it has not been effortless but it has been worthwhile louis has been insulin free for two weeks now  all five cats ages  to  love the food  their stools are good their coats look wonderful  they havent vomited for weeks yay
5189,5,this cat food has great healthy ingredients  cats shouldnt eat grain because it is not a part of their traditional diet  think mice rodents moles grasses rabbits bird etc  i switched my cat from iams canned food to this one thinking that i would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it  however she ate it immediately i was so happy  as another reviewer said there are whole peas in this stuff  it looks a little gross but my cat eats it however i must admit that she will eat just about anything  her favorite treats are sproated oat grass spinach and broccoli stalks  shes a good eaterbr br before i switched to felidae grain free my cat was vomiting frequently  i think it was due to food allergies either to grain or food coloring maybe  since switching she has only thrown up one time you can only imagine how happy i am to not have to clean up vomit every other daybr br also since switching my cats fur is much more smooth and soft
5190,5,no more dry kibble for our felines  after a few medical emergencies and educating myself why cats are not designed by mother nature to eat dry kibble any brand i changed our clan of felines to healthy wet foodbr every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the erbr with all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry we rotate  different brands of food felidae is one  it has no grains soy corn or icky fillers felidae is a pate loaflike consistencybr since changing to a wet food only diet none of our cats have been back to er in years  none throw up  no runny eyes  coats are shiny no matted hair  all are at a perfect weight  the changes are amazingbr having  cats i am very thankful for the  oz size cans of felidaebr i had a question recently and sent felidae an email  they answered very promptly and were very kind  their customer service deserves  stars also
5191,5,id been feeding them wellness until the recent recall after checking some reviews i looked around for something comparably healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot theyre always enthusiastic at mealtimes but theyve been literally climbing over each other at mealtimes for this one caveat unlike the wellness it has a pull tab which is good news bad news no need to mess with a can opener but its absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess
5192,1,this slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpetbr br she devours the felidae platinum which we feed as an occasional alternative to newmans own turkey she was raised on felidae dry so i can say that generally the canidae company provides quality products except for this grainfree slop you can find the good stuff at a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbwflsfelidae canned cat food for senior and overweight cats platinum diet formula pack of   ounce cansabr br absolutely do not order this slop from amazon because they will charge you  for the privilege of returning the  cans your cat will not eat before you make the same stupid mistake i did buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first then when your cat pukes this slop back up you will only be out  instead of the  amazon nailed mebr br in my opinion your cat and you will be much better off with newmans own organic cat food especially the turkey and chicken the newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death after we listened to our former vet and fed her science diet kd she dropped down to less than  pounds in a month we switched her back to newmans own turkey and within one case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of lbs and has maintained that healthy weight for over  months she also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the kd i read somewhere that science diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products nicebr br just say no to science diet and felidae grain free formula heres the good stuff a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbvkhjnewmans own organics turkey  vegetable formula for cats ounce cans pack of abr br did they really want me to post a video with this review would you then its unanimous this review will remain videofree
5193,5,great price and my cat loves this food  he has been on it for  years  my vet says he is the healthest cat he sees
5194,2,ive been feeding wellness grainfree for a while now and all three of them love it i ordered the felidae last time because the wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the felidae was  which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at petco brick and mortarnone of my cats will eat it they actually at nothing for the past  days since the only thing offered them was the felidae i broke down today and gave them a backup can of lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now i think felidae is a high quality food and i only feed the lower quality grainfree food on rare occasion but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter hopefully something there will like it im off for the trip to petco for the wellness
5195,3,my cats arent usually picky and ive had them on natural balance venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems probably from ten years of eating junk kitty food so i keep trying to find a food that will help to heal him i tried felidae and he and one other cat eats it but the other two dont i do believe one is extremely picky because he wont eat halo brand either but loves the natural balance and taste of the wild grain free options i hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats also  this says  protein derived from fish  so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish its too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time oh well its a another miss in our family
5196,4,my youngest cat goes insane over this stuff  which is good  shes the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens  my older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture compared to her favorite canned food although she loved the taste right away  once she got used to it we started going through this case like it was going out of style and i had to buy more  i have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case compared to many of the foods we use  that was a big bonus for me and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods
5197,5,i have the coolest different cats everwith some exotic in themand this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it it does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of minedo not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is very much a plus  the price on amazon is better for a largecan amount  per ounce than i can find at local pet shops or stores  so when you can get the free shipping it is really awesome to have pet foods at your doorservice too i hope amazon will just continue to make pet food  supplies to your home affordable and at a top price  sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find the same dealsavailable  so i just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is offered again to make it affordable not sure why that happens but i know i have to watch it to make sure i dont end up with a high shipping fee in my cartprior to purchase
5198,5,cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet  not a whole lot but their typical prey in the wile would probably have vegetation in their stomachs when killed and eaten  that being said my kitties are weird and love to eat vegetables  i have a toddler that likes to throw his food around so inevitably some ends up on the floor and they are there to pounce when it falls  the ingredients in this food are wholesome my kitties eat this food whole peas and all and it makes their coats wonderfully soft and silky  this is not the only wet food i feed them but it is one i do plan on keeping in their wet food rotation  i give it my solid recommendation
5199,5,we recently adopted a new kitten we rotate felidae grainfree canned formula with wellness turkey canned food he loves both and eats well hes never left a single whole pea behind this is a very highquality cat food using excellent allmeat proteins he is healthy activeaffectionate and has a smooth glossy coat definitely worth the cost in the long runbr br i believe it is worthwhile to rotate different highquality canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will only eat one brand i think this is useful also in the event of a recall im looking for a rd highquality brand to add to the rotation
5200,5,i adopted my adorable edmund last year from a shelter they sent me home with a small bag of felidae not grain free version cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the timebr i am very concerned about eating healthy whole foods so i of course want the best for my kitty as well i did research and found that cats digestive systems are not designed to eat any grainsfruitsvegetables directly and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their preys stomachs ie if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it so i wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to whats found in nature as possible without breaking the bankbr he already seemed to really like the felidae grainincluded version so as soon as my starter bag ran out i immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has only eaten this ever since i got him  he loves itbr i give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large oz felidae grain free food weve tried both the turkeychicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and edmund prefers the turkeychicken but will eat anything i give him  i bought some can lids at petsmart and they seal air tight on these cans  so fridge storage is clean and easybr br he has the absolute softest shiniest fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy  we havent had a single vet visit since i adopted him even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when i got him they all cleared up i have to blame at least some of all this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food the rest is because i love him so ridiculously muchbr br i love the free shipping on amazon i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry or two of one at the same time i used to buy this elsewhere and since its so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product
5201,1,the consistency of the grain free chicken turkey lamb and fish formula was likebr baby poop  there was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through abr full case in a short time  i can put the water in the cat food  it is misleadingbr and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product call it a  oz canbr and provide nothing like i have come to know and expect from other brands the samebr size
5202,2,i was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my  cats looks like it has good ingredients but none of my  cats will eat it in fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing
5203,3,first off my cats loved the food one of them has had issues in the past and i need to be careful with what i feed him and this seems to work well however about half the cans were your normal semisolid catfood consistency and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking they ate both kinds with equal gusto so i dont think anything was wrong with it per se but i still found it a little concerning im ordering another batch and well see how that turns out
5204,3,i gave it  stars because of the quality ingredients but if neither of my cats will eat it whats the use we tried weaning them to this food from the junk weve been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of felidae or by getting them real hungry first all to no avail the only way theyll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves or from cans of sardinesbr br more than anything i think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste because it smells pretty good to me
5205,3,wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole if i dont mush them several of my cats just eat around thembr the cats  i all prefer the regular felidae formula and its a little cheaper too
5206,5,this yuban dark roast is outstanding  it is smooth with a chocolaty taste  i find it as good as any far more expensive coffees  i would also recommend purchasing the ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing itbr br i do not like many dark roasted coffees because i dont like the burnt taste  yuban dark roast has no burnt or bitter taste  definitely shun the regular roast for this onebr br also keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks starbucks is far far overrated bitter burnt
5207,5,if you like strong coffee this is it  the flavor is exceptional i have not found better in a can  this can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store  i have had great luck with amazon good price for the subscription order you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate  amazon also has a wonderful return policybr try yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you this may be it  we have been drinking it for  years now  have had the original organic and dark roasti dont have a preference they are all excellent
5208,5,my husband and i are always searching for better coffeeand seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all lol i have finally decided that yuban is without fail my favorite coffeeit has no aftertaste is not bitter in any way and it remains constant can after can on that note my husband can go grabbing different can after and grinding himself silly if he wishes  complaining about each oneim settled on yuban forevaaaaaaa  
5209,5,excellent  we have enjoyed yuban coffee for many years  we recently tried the dark roast coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee  smooth with no bitterness  beats the high price of many gourmet coffees without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for
5210,5,yuban makes the best cup of coffee either roast is never bitter and makes a great cup of coffee we like our coffee extrastrong and we have been using yuban for years the coffee is very consistent and distinctivebr br this is the best canned ground coffee out there period we have found none to match the true dark smooth cup of coffee there is no bitterness or burnt taste just silky rich coffee add a dab of halfnhalf and you have bliss in a cupbr br dont spend your money on the expensive designer coffees this is the bestbr br if you are persnickety about coffee buy yuban
5211,5,living in baton rouge my wife and i drank the popular regional coffee  community coffee we now guess out of loyalty when we became full time rvers in february  we packed  lbs of that coffee but ran out in missouri so we tried other dark roast including maxwell house gourmet dark roast and then the yuban dark roast omg  what a differencebr br well never buy anything except yuban dark road  smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter tastebr br difficult to find in south louisiana but easier nationwide then theres always amazon with delivery within daysbr br ya gotta try it
5212,2,yikes  what was i thinking when i ordered  cans of this  stuff  the food pantry may be getting somebr br it tastes likewell i cant use the words id like tobr lets just say that it has no character at allno distinct tasteif yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee i dont know if youd even know it was coffeebr br i use just more than the amount suggessteddoesnt help
5213,5,i can only say that this is great coffee never tried before until recently now i like it better than folgers
5214,3,i was drinking yuban organic medium roast coffee until i could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so i tried this instead  what a let down after drinking the organic coffee  this just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to folgers but the organic stuff now thats a different story that stuff is good tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at dunn bros or caribou coffee houses  dont believe me try both this and the organic version side by side  you wont go back to this again i promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all
5215,5,until recently i thought that coffee was coffee but apparently its not that simple drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad onebr br the good news is going green is easy look for the certification by environmental watchdogs like the rainforest alliance and keep up the demand for arabica uhrabihkuh or rainforest blend coffee just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee housebr br gogreenmartmore voted yuban as a product of the week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well
5216,3,i wish they hadnt changed the formula for the yuban that was sold up until about  years ago i even contacted general foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their original formula from many years ago why they had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market yuban was a special treat now it is just ordinary i still like it for everyday coffee but it sure isnt what it used to be formerly i even preferred it to starbucks but no more
5217,5,we had not been able to find the dark roast yuban in any of the stores recently when i ordered this they gave me a date of receipt it actually came two days earlier my husband was so excited when he saw what i had ordered thanks for the quick service on a great product
5218,2,warning it contains food preservatives other than that it is fine but presence of preservatives in dates  justifies my low  star rating
5219,5,i own a small night club and this is hands down the most popular snack item we have at first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore in addition it is not available anywhere in town and before we found it here we had to go to a sams club  miles away to stock up on it apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find the company also makes a club mix as opposed to the pub mix i made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele they look about the same but apparently the club mix lacks some vital ingredient
5220,5,i received a whole package of this delicious tasty perfectly seasoned mix that contains just the correct variety of snacks pretzels crackers nuts etc   of course here in iraq we look forward to receiving care packages and the awesome snacks they contain  however this snack was the cats meow  it is honestly the best snack mix i have ever tasted and my fellow marines agree on this also  once it was eaten by all everyone was inquiring where i had received it and i could only say a caring patriot who included it in one of their care box of goodiesbr br   i loved it so much that i ended up on this page because i decided to go online and search for it and see if i can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in iraq  i dont mind paying a few extra bucks for it to have for me and my fellow marines to enjoy  its just that good that its worth itbr br   this is a great product and all should try it  after you do you wont think that chex mix can light even a dim candle next to the utz pub mix  believe me try it and youll want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy
5221,5,i found these tubs at costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them i buy the pack here at amazon and i am very satisfied the snacks are tasty not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely
5222,5,this is definitely the best snack mix i have ever had  it got me and my buddies through many movie nights while deployed in iraq
5223,5,i agree with all who have said that this is a great snack but i just wanted to say that i piad  for a  pack of  oz containers from the actual utz site
5224,3,this pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure  i tend to pick up a tub of it at the local walmart here anytime i venture there  the flavor of it is really hard to pin down  its sorta a salty garliconionwhatever type of blend that truly works deliciously  im a self confessed snackaholic that has tried just about everything around and personally i have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend  its really good with your favorite beer or just by itself and i highly recommend it  the only down side to this stuff is the price  which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with utz products which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part  unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good this mix is not easily found locally  i see it only at the local walmart here in the small  oz size that carries a hefty price  i buy it anyway on occasion for its so good but make no mistake about it its not cheap as snack chips go  and unfortunately i do not recommend buying this mix on amazon in any size  its way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered  if you wanna try it or like it already i suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores its never found in supermarkets round these parts spring for the price and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy
5225,5,i tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty much better than chips or other mixes i was told it was sold in sams club and wegmans for  per  z container bought it from utz in a  pack for br each piece has a different taste and texturecould not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price thank you utz
5226,5,hands down the best snack you will ever voraciously consume at a potentially unhealthy pacebr br it does contain msg so do be warned but if that does not dissuade you as it would never me give this a shot this has been a godsend during road trips movie knights parties and general gettogethers of all kinds
5227,5,enjoyed the product and they also provided very fast shipping  im about out and need to order more
5228,5,this mix is great anytime  i love it  would recommend it to anyone that likes chex mix
5229,5,i absolutely love this mix  we keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it
5230,5,i found this mix at the ft myer commissary  i looked for this product last time i visited the commissary and could not find it  so here i am online looking and found it here  i could eat this all day  ive tried several different snack mixes but most have too many pretzels  this has a very nice balance of flavors and textures  and not a lot of pretzels  im stocking up
5231,5,this is an addicting fantastic snack mix it has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors
5232,1,the taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the msg  those who are sensitive beware  also msg addition is usually a way to fake true flavor
5233,3, the problem with this mix  and to mind the only problem  is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little things this provides an experience of well repugnance at least for me ive never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose and this surely aint converting me especially when theyre in the same bitehandful ughbr br otherwise this mix is really yummy it all tastes rather waxy and im sure is not the healthiest food in the world though you could do worse but its a well combined mixturebr br but then again ive got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace because i must grab a handful and then separate the rejects maybe im just neurotic or maybe they made a fatal mistake and should be punishedbr br oh yeah like the last reviewer i too got em at costco
5234,4,cat grass seeds will sprout very easilyyou can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss  my cats eat the sprouts very quickly  i suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs  i did so to insure that i would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled  the only drawback is shipping costwhich is more than the seed packets themselves  thats another reason to order in multiples  the shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet
5235,5,this is good stuff  however i planted it and no cats grew up  just grass
5236,5,cat grass is not only a treat that cats love to eat it is also good for them and will help deter them away from eating houseplants  my cat often nibbles on houseplants then throws up and im always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system  when there is cat grass around though she only eats that  she really chows it down and it makes her happy too  cat grass is also good for cats  it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur ballsbr br even if you do not have a green thumb cat grass is so easy to grow that anyone can do it and its also a great project for kids too  the seeds sprout very quickly if you keep them moist and will grow quickly to inches in a window sillbr br if you have cats cat grass is a must
5237,1,the packet of these seeds that i received must have been old because i dont believe even  of them grew i tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass i garden regularly i live in florida so its not that i dont know how and i even followed the instructions to the letter but they did not grow
5238,5,ive had luck with this seed and all the other packets ive purchased from botanical interests the company that makes itbr right now the packets over a year old and i recently planted another pot and had a high germination rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four daysbr the cats love it they ate so much i planted yet another potbr having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things like plastic especially when they are having digestive problems
5239,5,great product  the indoor kitties love to have grass to nibble on  this grass grows and is ready to nibbling in  days or lessbr my howtobr get a small shallow plastic container with a lidbr punch several holes in the bottom of the container with a nailbr fill the container with organic soil sprinkle about  tablespoon of seeds on top pack the seeds into the soil by pressing them in firmly wbr ater until some of kit leaks out the holes in the bottombr place on a dish put on the lid keep out of the way for the seeds to germinate checking to water every  daysbr once the grass has grown about  inches remove the lid and place in the sunbr put grass in a new heavier bowl so the cats cant pull the entire patty of grass out or walk off with the container with they nibble it
5240,5,yum i am so happy my mom bought this delicious and nutritious cat grass for me  it helps me digest my food and is just fun to poke around in when im bored  and i notice that mom eats it too when she thinks im not looking because it is so tasty
5241,5,i use this to grow my cat grass every month or so  now that its spring i can find the terra cotta pots at the stores again  i just keep two and alternate so he always has grass growing  he loves it so i bought several packs at once probably more than ill need  i get several batches out of each packet none have been duds so far either
5242,5,cat grass also known as wheat grass is a great plant for anyone i typically dont do any type of gardening but i had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow these seeds make a great project for gardeners cat lovers and children toobr br the hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely thats what happened to mine at least and my cats still  several months later  will check the area where i kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant
5243,5,received this product much sooner than promised seeds grow as claimed and plant is great my cat loves it highly recommend product and seller
5244,5,this stuff is awesomebr br grows very fast and grows into a full grass sectionbr br my cat loves it and with other cat grasses i have purchased she has vomited after sometimes but this stuff she hasnt so farbr br like another reviewer said shipping for one package is same price if you buy  so stock up and save on shipping and the package was very nice wasnt just thrown in an envelope
5245,4,we have been buying cat grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packagesbr br our cats have grown healthy and happy since they have this grassbr br great seller  delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again
5246,3,cat grass is cat grass and i have one cat that absolutely loves it another that couldnt care less  its winter now so i couldnt find it where i buy seeds so i went on line  product is okay service was prompt  my disappointment could only order one twoounce package per shipping and handling fee  cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks and i would have ordered  or  packages but not at  or  times that shipping fee
5247,5,so these seeds do exactly as advertised  i bought  paks of seeds and have so far used   i always get a pot full of strong bright green grass which my cat readily devours  not much else can be said  good deal good grass man
5248,5,i have been growing this cat grass for my  little dog however i dont have the nerve to tell them this is for cats  i noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants i decided to grow my ownbr my little guys love this stuff but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots  all  i have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowlbr trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster much like your lawn  as with your lawn i find that adding nutrients iron to the grass it keeps its beautiful color and many months of fresh new grassbr  dont know the exact reason my dogs like grass it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets  guess you might say dogs cant live on meat alone or something like that
5249,4,i planted this grass and in  days i had  inches of grassbr br the price hurts since youre basically paying for shipping the cost of the seeds themselves are  as shown on the package i couldnt find oat grass seeds at lowes or my local independent garden center im hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so i can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship
5250,5,the grass sprouted quickly with a great germination rate the cats love it so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while i was out of town the pot was upside down for at least a day and it looked like the grass was all going to die however a week later it has almost fully recovered so its pretty hearty
5251,5,our cats love the grass  its easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually  an excellent product to maintain a cats health
5252,5,i wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house i planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil i had a large bunch of grass in about a week my cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen
5253,5,i normally purchase alreadygrown containers of cat grass at my local pet store however the last few pots developed bugs in them which just wasnt sanitary i bought these seeds from hirts and they grew insanely fast my cats love the taste ive already bought another pack so i can replant once the cats finish off this batch
5254,5,these seeds grow very easy one seed pack grew about  little pots i would grow using a few seeds about every  days in  separate little pots for my cats so they never was without a great buy
5255,5,excellent germination  only  days and about  of the seeds are up to an inch  if i hadnt done this before the instructions would have been wonderful they left nothing out i will buy these again
5256,5,this was the only seed pack i bought of three different brands that came up and the cats are still enjoying
5257,5,tiger loves the cat grassit only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come upso it grows very fasti planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside
5258,5,it was so easy to grow and my cat loved it i highly recommend this purchase your cat will love you forever
5259,5,unfortunately bunnies love it too so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors  the cats love this stuff  just put it where they can reach it and they will go to town on it munching it all up  it does not make them behave erratically like catnip does so dont worry about that  you dont have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly  thats it  a nutritious treat for your cats
5260,5,these seeds always grow unlike some other brands every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass there is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so unanimouslybr br thanks for such a great batch of seeds
5261,5,in less than a week my kitties had grass to much on  i was surprised with their reaction to it it seemed like she was given this before at her previous home  she rushed right to it as soon as she saw it and gnawed it down to nothing  the first time it got eaten the plants sprang back to life and grew faster than before but after being annihilated a second time the grass kind of dried up and died  which is okay because i have plenty more seeds in the pack
5262,5,excellent product and price would do business with this company againbr my cat loves it cant wait to plant it again
5263,5,the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds and they grew very easily in pots too
5264,5,i bought  packets and planted one of them  it only took a couple of days for the sprouts  my cats love it
5265,5,my two cats must not be interested in grass because it grew but they ignored it had no problems growing it
5266,3,it was hard to grow but once it grew my cat loved it i havent found any seeds that work well yet but i am still looking i would buy this again isf i had better luck with growing it
5267,5,this product is great for growing cat grass  gives a hearty grass is easy  fast growing  will purchase in the future
5268,5,it got here fast grew quickly and my cats love it excellent choice anyone can make their cats very happy by purchasing this product plus my cats have completely stopped chewing on all other plants in the house
5269,5,our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too i have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house recommended product
5270,5,i have  cats could care lessthe other one loves this so much  i have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day  no throwing up like outside grass
5271,3,my cat love this grass really easy to grow only  days im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are  seeds
5272,5,i have  cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught  this to see if they like it  even though its just out grass lol
5273,3,dont know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night but this will get the job done vomit stains carpets beds shirts you will find hard old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too  entire rooms of carpet will need replacingbr br if you have all wood floors and love cat vomit go for itbr br however it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on its own or mixed with herbs just keep out of cats reach good air freshener if you grow enough indoorsbr br no idea why people want cat vomit indoors thoughbr br  stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more
5274,5,i just picked these up at random at my local asian market and i am really impressed id drive the  minutes there again just to pick these up they have an excellent coffee flavor and arent horribly sweet like most hard candies each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time
5275,4,great candy sweet and intense low calorie and delightful made with actual coffee not just flavoring fantastic reasonably priced too
5276,4,japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on amazon than elsewhere made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy
5277,5,there is nothing wrong with this product but it is overpriced  with a little research you can buy this for less than half the price  buyer beware
5278,5,my cats really love this  lives seafood and poultry cat foodbr they prefer this pate to the slices or chunksbr they are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coatsbr and lots of energybr it is good quality food and is very fresh
5279,4,we enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars  my  year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again  he loves to pack these for school snack
5280,5,my  year old recently was diagnosed allergic to gluten these pb  j bars have saved us he loves them and these are his favorite flavor
5281,4,i tried these bars and they were very good although i do like the peanut butter chocolate chip bars better the bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go
5282,5,out of all the granola bars that bakery on main makes my  year old loves these the most maybe its because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich but in a snack bar  we always have to have a box of this flavor in the house
5283,4,these are good bars for being gluten free  not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack  if you really want to try something great try their coconut cashew trubar  now thats incredible its like you are being naughty but youre not
5284,5,you just cant go wrong with peanut butter and jelly these were so delicious as with the apple cinnamon i had a hard time keeping my gluten free fearing husband away from these yummy
5285,5,one of the best peanut butter bars ive ever had the fruit jelly is so good and brings the whole thing together in a good snack or dessert
5286,5,of all the flavors i have tried of these bars the peanut butter and jelly is my favorite  everyone loves peanut butter and jelly and it is just as delicious as a bar
5287,5,this is my favorite granola bar being vegan and glutenfree is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my  needs this one is absolutely delicious i love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar  highly recommend
5288,5,my sweet daughter loves these  i mean what kid doesnt love pbj and what mom loves not having to make it  they are sweet and make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free  highly recommend it
5289,4,wonderful my son loves these granola bars he has celiac and we wanted to try something different these were a hit
5290,5,my girls love these bars  they are nice for lunches or quick snacks on the go  good flavor  gluten free and dairy free is difficult but bakery on main does it right  yummy
5291,4,peanut butter and jelly together how can you go wrong it is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better
5292,5,i love these  they really taste like a soft pbj sandwich and you can bring them anywhere  kids would love them too  i hope theyre available again soon because im running low
5293,5,childhood nostagia all over again i love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but i dont often make them because theyre rather messy these bars solve that problem the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor thats in the bar the best part is that i can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up
5294,4,it is cubes for our horses they came in on time and the horses like them there is not much more to say about sugar cubes
5295,5,all my horses love a sweet reward dots hold together nicely in the reward bag
5296,4,the fact that the title of this product includes the number  is misleading  im not even sure what that number refers to  i can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package which is   its true that the product details stated the actual quantity of  but apparently i glossed over that fact  the price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on amazon just not quite as good as i had originally thought  shipping took a week longer than expected but i did receive and apology email  the gumballs themselves were well packagedbr i would buy from this vendor again assuming that the consumption of  gumballs does not kill me
5297,5,i love this tea it is hands down my favorite  and the ingredients are very clean and its low calorieespecially compared to other teas out there  this is the real deal  its basically like making it at homebr br its so yummy  light refreshing  i could drink it all day by the gallon  
5298,5,my husband and i love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners  most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink  it is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst  i only wish that amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis
5299,1,look at the ingredientsit is made with black teagoogle black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much much  much less fluoride than either black or green teas
5300,3,just received a case of this tea  it tastes good and a bit on the sweet side but not overly sweet  i would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in china though
5301,5,since republic of tea discontinued their bing cherry vanilla tea i was looking for a replacement  the flavor of this tea is very different from republics  its better  the smell is very rich like toasted vanilla and cherry  it almost has a coffee smell but not quite  i dont like coffee but this tea is incredible  glad i found it  best of all the price
5302,4,i really like this tea but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like robitussin cough syrup  the taste is more subtle than the aroma  overall this tea tastes good and is a good value  its not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea i have ever tasted but i would purchase it again
5303,5,if you can get over the high price why not enjoy some of the best coffee in the world right here in the good ol usabr br warning once you get spoiled by this coffee you might not ever settle for lessbr br bottom line great product would recommend to a friend
5304,5,i have a bag of this coffee shipped to me every other month i do notice the flavor can vary over time with that said the worse ive had was just plain great and the best roasts are to die for ive noticed this variation with other coffees too i always assumed it was the minute differences in roasting and of course the bean itself being a plant it will hardly have the exact same characteristics of another plant perhaps weather variations count too this last year the flavor and taste has been more consistent than it was a few years back everyone has different tastes but speaking for myself this is as close to perfect as it gets
5305,3,i enjoyed my st cup very much  the aroma was heady and the flavor was pleasantly mild  but ultimately it is too mild for my daily morning kick ill be going back to my lavazza mornings when this is gone
5306,4,tried this because it is  kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using what can i say i am greatly surprised mild no bite too it and no discernable acidity this is on my shopping list from now on
5307,2,spent   for real kona coffee and didnt want the kona blend sold here the hawaiian roasters was disappointing tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in maui not good
5308,5,this is by far the best kona coffee ive had i use to purchase trader joes kona coffee but for the last several months they havent had any and ive been unable to locate kona any where so i thought id try amazon i saw this and although the price is staggering the coffee is amazing very smooth with great taste i drink it both hot and cold a pound makes a lot of coffee and while i didnt figure the price per cup i still think its worth it and will purchase it again
5309,5,i have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors and i can say that this one is a very special coffee i made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags ive bought the coffee lost its freshness in the nd bag and it was very old dry and tasteless i was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag i wasnt sure what was the problem cause the st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic the freshness texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana i was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee immediately i knew that this was a very special gourmet coffeebr br ive tried different regional coffees including papa new guinea kenya aa sumatra beans jamaican blue mountain  and others i have to say that kona is my favorite by far the shipping bag comes oxygen free when its being shipped from the vendor the air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping i guess thats what happened to one of the bags as you know coffee and oxygen dont go well together cause once the coffee is oxidized it starts losing its freshness and it doesnt taste the way its supposed to tastebr br ive made a recent purchase again and im very happy with the results give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment you have got nothing to lose well done hawaii roasters you guys have outdone yourselves
5310,5,my son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back hawaii roaster kona coffee they have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees i thought i would check to see if it was on amazon this is the best tasting coffee i ever tasted  well worth the money
5311,5,this coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee  i like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings  the daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type
5312,5,this coffee whether brewed in the keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale  not the awardwinning coffee that i expected to taste  it didnt take me back to hawaii but instead took me to the folgers coffee aisle in the grocery store  will not order again  what a waste of moneybr br updated   the seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money  he apologized for the coffee not being up to standard  the seller has good communication  maybe i just got a bad batch  who knows  thank you
5313,5,this coffee was delicious i actually purchased it as a gift but since i paid  for  lb of coffee i tasted the freakin coffeebr br it was so good i meant to purchase the light roast but accidentally ordered the medium it was full bodied and delicious totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees i cant afford  pure kona all the time and normally buy blends but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then
5314,5,the best thing i like about this sports drink is its not an energy drink low calories  and less caffeine then  ounces of coffeebr br plethora of natural antiinflammatory ingredients which mitigates aches and pains and its not necessary to take over the counter acetaminophen when you have thisbr br when i first had some i felt different not a amp different rushed just different scared me a bit  days later i tried it again the feel different was the pain level going from the constant  to a  which is manageable for me the feel difference was me feeling betterbr br this is giving me the  year window i need before i have to get my neck and spine fused againbr br at our house now we have at least  cases and this month it is 
5315,4,this jerky is quite pricey for a  ounce bag but its one of the few ive found that is salty enough and doesnt contain a bunch of sweetenersbr br the smoke flavor is also pronounced  unfortunately the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting  stars from me
5316,5,ive reviewed this before  this jerky is fabulous great salt great snap great flavor so tasty i want some now
5317,5,these were a wonderful surprise more delicious than anticipated and guiltfree i liked the smaller size pouches easy to carry with me nice to give as a gift the bonus is that they are organic i will be buying more
5318,5,i picked up a package during an airport layover and since i wont be back to lax soon decided to check amazon for some more  the  oz package cost  at the airport so you do get a small price break by buying them here in triple packsbr wow  the flavor is amazing  i dont know if the other reviewer got a bad batch  or what  but mine were crunchy walnuts with the smoothest slightly sweet tasting thick dark chocolate coating  one bite and i was hookedbr if you are looking for a sweet treat for your sweetie look no further  this should be in every adult easter basket or christmas stocking  i havent raved about a candy like this since sees dark chocolate covered raspberry cremesbr br if you like walnuts and dark chocolate you will absolutely love these  the taste is so pleasurable it is hard to describe  i just ordered  packages for me and to use as gifts  amazon you need to start selling these so i can use prime shipping  these will fly off the shelf i promisebr br ingredients  organic walnuts organic ark chocolate coating  ooh there is some organic chocolate liquour and soy lethicin in there thats why its so tasty and smooth  contains small amounts of milk soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts  made in the usa by tropical valley foodsbr br yes these will melt in your hand or the hot sun so be forewarned
5319,2,i like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness these nuts were chewy not crunchy and the chocolate coating was a bit mealybr if you know anything about dark chocolate and like yours with some snap dont order thesebr br actually the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called perigord and are available through a canadian company called kis globalbr they are sun dried super crispy covered in a fairly thin shell of  dark chocolate and dusted with unsweetened cocoabr very adult and superb
5320,5,the walnuts and chocolate are very high quality they are rich and decadent it seems strange but when im eating just a small piece it tastes like im eating a brownie highly recommended
5321,4,the product is greatbut it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces  i am sure it was over heated in the shipping  we live in central california where temperatures get into the s  i am  able to use them anyway by just cutting them upbr partly my faulti will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weatherbr excellent product
5322,5,these smell so good im tempted to try them myself  i have to keep real chocolate locked up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will raid cupboards and chew open drawers to get to it but they are very happy with these instead  im so glad i found this safe alternative for them
5323,5,my dogs and some other dogs i like to spoil too just love these  they are their special treats
5324,5,i must say that vitakraft has put life back into my dog he is old and vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops
5325,5,i found these at a local pet store and couldnt locate them again  great price and dogs love them  i recd my shipment quickly with no problems
5326,5,i bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight  im not sure how or why this worksbut it stopped them from peeing  the dogs love em too
5327,5,have been buying this product for over a year and max would eat  it as fast as i could give it to him however one or two drops at a time for a reward is his limit  yogurt is his favorite
5328,5,my dog loves vitakraft dog drops with carob so much hell do any trick possible to have one  sadly theyre getting harder and harder to find so i was thrilled to find them here  and the price was great
5329,5,a superior dog treat with a chocolate flavor these drops are not toxic to dogs and are vitamin enriched my dogs just love them  my grandchildren ate few thinking they were hershey kisses the childrens mother who is a pharmacist stated that the drops were not toxic to children or dogs the  product is excellentservice from the amazon supplier was excellent but i wish they any supplier would not use ups as a shipper ups is slower than snail mail
5330,5,my puppy megabyte is a very picky puppy  after spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat  these are one of only two
5331,1,we ordered the productour dog loves thembut no one cares if its  degrees outside  recieved in one big melted ball  thought they would ship in dry ice  if its summer or hot in your area dont order them 
5332,5,my pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one  i can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere  they are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her
5333,5,my dog loves these treats i can get him to do anything using them they were much cheaper using amazon even with the shipping charges
5334,1,by the time i received this product all  packages were melted so all had to be thrown away because everything in each bag had melted together
5335,1,i can not believe that this is actually for sale it needs to be recalled sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets they do not digestassimilate sugar like we do every vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list if you do see it on the list do not buy it
5336,1,this is my nd review for this product  the first one was supposed to be  words  that would be too long for this item  the product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous  the package was small and light weight but i was charged  for shipping of a  item  i have bought many items from amazoncom and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand i bought several items and the shipping was all together  therefore i did not know how much was charged for each item i will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping  enough said
5337,5,key lime pie is one of my alltime favorite desserts when i heard about this gum i was definitely a skeptic i figured itd taste more like just a standard citrusymint gum i was wrong this definitely tastes like real keylime pie filling actual keylime flavor with a milksweet taste thats not too overpowering the flavor actually lasts for quite a while too though its much more powerful within the first  minutes try it
5338,5,but ill give it a shot  wow  so far i have only tried and intend to try the key lime pie and the mint chocolate chip but they are both amazing  they key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about  seconds  the mint chocolate chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer or at least the dulled postflavor gum is more appealing  in any event even for  seconds of flavor these gums are a gem  great idea by wrigley
5339,5,key lime pie is getting rave reviews throughout my office  i bought a pack of it to share with my coworkers as well as the mint chocolate chip and strawberry shortcake varieties  all have been tasty but key lime pie has been the star  excellent
5340,5,i just got a pack of the key lime pie gum and it is some of the best gum ive had it really tastes like key lime pie almost eerily so and is flavorful but not too strong the idea of dessert flavored gum sounds a little like willy wonka but it tastes really good and i am looking forward to trying the other flavors
5341,5,never did i think i could put a piece of gum into my mouth and actually experience pie  you can seriously taste the crust the filling and even the whipped cream on time  i dont know how they did it but its amazing
5342,5,i am addicted to this gum it tastes so close to the real thing and doesnt lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry this best flavor of all of this series along with the mint chocolate chip
5343,4,i like the dessert delights line and this is one of their better flavors but the carton i received contains only packs that are stale the sticks are stiff and difficult to chew and the flavor disappears within  minutes im quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers
5344,5,i couldnt find the gum at the grocery store so i ordered it from amazon the order came quickly and the gum was great
5345,5,thankfully i was able to order quite a supply of this gum my sister and i enjoy this flavor the most and was sad to read it was discontinued  i paid a responable price so i thank you
5346,5,its almost eerie how this gum tastes so similar to actual key lime pie i just picked up my first pack today i this is definitely my new flavor extra really hit the mark here a different unique and incredibly delicious gum this scrumptious delicious treat is sure to please dont hesitate to buy a pack
5347,5,i panicked when i couldnt find my extra key lime pie gum in the stores  then i thought where can you get just about everything  amazon of course  and to my delight my gum was there  if you love key lime pie like i do this is the next best thing to sinking your teeth into a creamy rich key lime tart delicious piece of pie without the calories
5348,5,wow  i like the flavors ive tried the apple pie mint ice cream and the strawberry shortcake not too fond of this one but the others are great i love the apple pie and this key lime piebr br it says hydrogenated starch not oils difference
5349,5,this gum is delicious and since my first pack i have been hooked  i love the mint chocolate chip after meals and the key lime pie is delectable at all other timesbr br at  pack on amazon its not really a deal though considering this is only a  a pack at target or mcwallymart  once the price of a pack drops to about  or  i might consider buying it online if only out of pure laziness but a  premium is not really worth it
5350,5,i loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting everyone in the office eats it now we only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks but so far i have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor  if you like a bright citrusy taste that is not too overpowering you will love this if you like a more minty gum then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum
5351,5,i was actually very surprised that this tasted like the real deal its very sweet very limey and the first couple hundred chews you can taste the crust and a smidge of whip cream after a few minutes it still has flavor after an hour it still has flavor i love it you also get the tangy effect of a lime not as strong but very pleasurable
5352,5,i did not expect this gum to be more than just your typical lime flavored candy type taste but i was floored this gum literally tastes like key lime pie i swear i can even taste a graham cracker crust the flavor only lasts a short time but its an amazing taste floored
5353,5,this is the absolute best gum flavor ever  it really tastes like key lime pie and the flavor lasts a long time yummy
5354,3,not bad but there are better gums than this one at the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation but after  minutes is gone
5355,5,not being a hard core gum chewer i was thrilled with this gum a great taste in a gum that last plenty long without any loss of flavor or any kind of after taste a pleasure in my diet routine
5356,5,ive tried wrigleys apple pie flavor of their dessert delights chewing gum  it tastes exactly like apple pie  i cant wait to try the key lime pie flavor  everyone who has posted a review here on amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie  wrigley chewing gum co appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park  john v karavitis john karavitis karavitis
5357,3,if ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years as the popular myth states this one is the most likely it tastes great sure but in the first few bites it falls apart losing any cohesiveness gummyness and just gets swallowed for some reason about  of it remains intact and becomes gum what little remains is as the other reviewers state but knowing that ive swallowed more than half the sticks ive chewed is not a pleasant thought
5358,5,i really like this gum like all of wrigleys gum products ive tried this is absolutely great these dessert delight flavors are truly delightful
5359,5,the extra dessert delights sugargree key lime pie flavored gum is an amazingly limey mouth party  it has a zesty tartness tempered with enough sweetness for balance  having a piece of gum taste so much like a food is a little disorienting and while i did not really think i would end up looking like a lime a la violet beauregard from willy wonka and the chocolate factory movie it was a relief that i did not  the only problem is that the flavor does not last as long as bubble gum or mint flavors  but that might just be too much to hope for
5360,5,like other reviewers i had low expectations for this gum but was happily wrong  i love key lime pie and lime flavor in general  when first chewed this gum has the tangybite of key lime with a creamy sweetness and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor  after the initial flavor burst fades there is that surge of artificial sugarysweetness that occurs with some brandsflavors of sugarfree chewing gum but the surge isnt as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums  once that fades the gum has a mellow subtle lime zest flavor  i really like this gum
5361,4,so far ive tried all of the flavors and while there are some im not over the hill about ive had pretty good experiences with thembr br this is one of the flavors id purchase again im a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored so i had to give this a try ill admit up front that i havent had a key lime pie for years so i dont remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor i remember it in general thoughbr br this tastes awesome i can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what i remember a key lime pie to be the lime flavor is there but its backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum hey its  calories a slice so i can splurge on this while i wouldnt want to splurge with the actual pie unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had the flavor doesnt last nearly long enoughbr br ill absolutely buy this again despite the flavor only lasting  minutes
5362,5,in this age where even basic service no longer exists i was pleasantly surprised when my transaction actually came off without a hitch shipped on time and the product was in good condition well done
5363,3,initially the flavor is fairly accurate however weak from there the flavor diminishes rapidly i just timed it and this gum goes flat within  minutesbr in light of my experience i find these rave reviews somewhat amusing one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as incredibly tart mehbr like many new products in the realm of gum pop energy drinks and fast food they only need you to buy one if everyone does that theyll be sitting prettybr based on this experience i have no desire to try the other flavors of extra dessert delightsbr three stars  its ok but doesnt live up to the hype
5364,1,on top of the delightful aspartame this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for country time lemonade mix
5365,2,instead of just being pork rinds oil salt and vinegar they have lactose and maltodextrin on them contributing to g of sugar per serving  many people myself included who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets they will not be happy about the sugarbr br the labeling on the package is very strange and i am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing  it says total carbohydrates are less then g so they get to put zero grams  ok fair enough i have seen that before  but then the label admits to  grams of sugar which is a carbohydrate  how they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are  grams of sugar is beyond me  i assume it is just that nobody has caught them yetbr br then there is protein  the nutritional analysis says g of protein per serving  not bad for a snack food  right next to the g is says not a significant source of protein  huha slice of cheese is about  grams of protein as is an ounce of meet  i believe those are significant sources of proteinbr br i went to their website to check out the nutritional facts  i did notice they were high in sodium  what i missed was that they claim the number of servings in a  oz package was three  so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher  i doubt many people expect a  oz package to be three servings  i just looked up fritos corn chips  a  oz package is considered a single serving package and the analysis on the back shows one serving  so when fritos tells you the sodium level it is only  mg for the entire package  for these pork rinds the  oz package is  mg of sodium about half of your daily requirement  a little steep for a snackbr br although i went to their site to look at some nutritional info they dont shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at amazon  if they had i would not have purchased it  they use partially hydrogenated oil a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term  since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label a lot of the food industry has switched away from it as people are correctly suspicious of itbr br to add insult to injury i was unhappy with the taste  they have a chemical nasty taste  i suppose that is subjective but a few bites left me a little queasybr br i feel bad having bought this but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack  please pass this companys products by and lets find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational ethical and legal way
5366,4,i love salt and vinegar potato chips but cant eat them on my lowcarb diet these pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those highcarb snacks the salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more muted than what i am used to finding in most potato chip brands but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy saltandvinegar snack the pork skins are light and fluffy with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some brands of pork skins if the flavoring was a bit more pronounced i would give this snack five stars
5367,5,if you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand ill eat these instead of chips any day
5368,4,wouldve rated  stars if it had more of a vinegar taste  overall not bad at all good snack
5369,4,cant find them anywhere where i live so glad i found them here not too salty or vinegary just the right amount thanks
5370,5,the customer service was beyond compare  i would gladly do business with this company again
5371,5,i have a hard time finding this up in new england  so glad to see this product here  this is my favorite product in my spice cabinet  i have tried many other socalled cajun spice blends and find that they are too salty although this is salty too it is not predominant on the palate or too hot which a true cajun spice is not hot  laissez les bon temps rouler
5372,5,this is a wonderful product i was happy to see i could buy it on amazon because our local stores quit carrying it  we use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wingyummy  it can be used on almost everything love it
5373,5,i just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning i have been making cajun catfish with this seasoning for about  years i have tried other seasonings when this one was not available but its just not the same if you want to try my recipe its very easy i melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generouslybr coat the fish with the seasoning meanwhile i preheat a cast iron skillet when the skillet is hot i put in about  tbs olive oil and than about  tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side about  minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish during this i make a pot of spaghetti my wife likes angle hair after the pasta is done drain it and remove the fish to a platter turn off the heat under the skillet add a little more olive oil and butter scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish everyone love it to give this dish a little color you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last  minutes of cooking or stir in a small can of diced cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet or use both hope you enjoy it if you try it
5374,5,this is the best cajun spice my wife and i have found anywhere ever  we have been using it for more than ten years  it goes great on all sorts of things  chicken beef pork fish eggs hard boiled scrambled or fried baked potato etc  not only is it a very good combination of spices it is also ground fine and mixed well  whenever we fry something in batter or breading luziannes cajun seasoning usually finds its way into the mixbr br weve tried slap ya momma and other cajun spices but those tend to be too coarse  instead of tasting a blend of spices you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt filling your mouth with the taste of salt then a nugget of pepper filling your mouth with the taste of pepper etc  luziannes is definitely the superior implementationbr br we recently ran out of it and to our dismay safeway has stopped carrying this product which is why we have tried other brands  none have measured up which is why i was searching for it online  were very happy to have found it again on amazon
5375,1,this product which i am not allowed to return has ingrediants of salt spices hydrolysed soy protein that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg but i digress so the third ingrediant is a form of msg further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed  monosodium gludamate msg this does not add spice to your food it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good when it does not msg can make dogfood taste like hamburger anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving alpo  tones and durkee sp do not contain msg i prefer tonesbr br i have  eight ounce cans of this stuff would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me
5376,1,i bought this seasoning because amazon stopped selling the  count konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a  count  i bought it thinking it would be similar to the konriko boy was i wrongbr br first of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows  hydrolyzed soy protein and partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil  i was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix  now i know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein as the other reviewer stated its a industry way of adding msg  well why in the world do we need that and whats up with the hydrogenated soy bean and cottonseed oil  beside it being bad for your health it causes the product to cake and clump  i steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them  an even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health  when i purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description now it is  i think that amazon as a regular practice should require all food productscompanys to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site  why wait until the customer purchase it to find out  i dont think this is a customer friendly practicebr br not a good buy imo  i found my konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there unless amazon brings it back at a  count offer otherwise to buy one at  and  sh is just way over priced and highway robbery
5377,5,i grew up using this seasoning on steak and pretty much everything could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon very happy nice spice and flavor highly recommend
5378,5,i love this product and cant get it locally anymore  it was a fair price and the item was in stock and came quickly  i would buy from them again
5379,5,this is a wonderful mix of spices  one of my favorite uses is on chicken on the grill  try this outbr br  cloves garlic mincedbr   tbsp luzianne cajun seasoningbr  tbsp olive oilbr  tbsp lemon juicebr br combine ingredients with chicken in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinate chicken legs  thighs for    hoursbr br mix up a second batch and brush over chicken while grilling cooking on all sidesbr br just made this yesterdayexcellent
5380,5,this is the best cajun seasoning ever we use it on seafood steaks and burgers seasoning enhances not overwhelms whatever it is put on
5381,5,i have been using luzianne cajun seasonings for years  i find it best on beef and fishseafood  like one of the other reviewers i like the fineness and the blend of the seasoning  the combination of the two gives it its unique flavorbr br when i have friends and family over for steaks they always say these are the best whats your secret  i first tell them its an old family secret but then i tell them about luzianne  i am not sure they are listning because the next time over we have to go through the same conversation  oh well more praise for mebr br thanks luzianne for all the pats on the back
5382,5,this seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish if you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning cant beat the price for a top notch product
5383,5,oh man i like many of us have tried so many cajun seasoning but this company does it rightbr br thank you folks at the heartheat of southern seasoningbr br all my lovebr roy watsonbr 
5384,5,i originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern maryland since then its always been in our cupboard we came home to pa that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer after a couple of years it became available in our area but in the last year or so we havent been able to find it anywhere this is one seasoning i dont mind buying by the case and its a great price toobr br we put it on virtually anything  and i mean anything meats poultry seafood salads spaghetti eggs pot pie vegetables soups whatever its especially good on any pasta dish i even sprinkle it on a sandwich the spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off it sounds weird but i think i could even enjoy this on ice cream
5385,5,luzianne cajun seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make it adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being overbearing my whole family loves it
5386,5,i have been using this spice mix for many years but i have found it hard to find lately i decided i would check amazon and i was very surprised to see it available i am a fairly good cook and i have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty a  pack is a lot of this spice but it does keep for years and i use it quite often give your family the kick it deserves with luzianne cajun seasoning
5387,4,we discovered earths best when my oldest started solids years ago  they had a more limited selection then but offered more variety than the regular brands  for him we only bought a few jars each trip those flavors that we couldnt get in another brand  for our second child we added a few more  with the rd baby we started out on the larger brands but he wouldnt eat them  who can blame him  theyre runny and lacking any flavor  not to mention no matter how good sweet potatoes are how many jars can you eat  he gobbles up every jar of earths best without any problems  when we introduce a new flavor hes all for itbr br i agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny  we just add a few tsp of cereal and problem solvedbr br earths best is more expensive  i calculated that every  weeks of food costs me  more than buying the other brands  however we decided that since he eats it all vs being very picky with other brands its a washbr br if you want to use earths best for your baby wout breaking the bank try these tipsbr visit earths bests website and print off all the coupons theyll allow usually  have family and friends do the samebr br buy at whole foods  they have good prices and when you buy a lot they give you a bulk discountbr br you can also buy them by the case at meijers for less than  cheaper than here
5388,3,i thought i was doing my kid a favor when i invested in a case of earths best dinners  unfortunately the second ingredient after water for all of these isapplesauce  or in the case of the sweet potato  chicken variety its sweet potatoes followed by apricot pureebr br after getting used to the sweetness of these try em  theyre like jam its difficult for kids to adjust to real food  from now on im going to stick with just pureeing homecooked food  its a lot cheaper too
5389,5,according to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall earths best was always voted to be in the top  of all the lists of reviews by mom links consumer reports livestrong baby health sites  here is a excerpt from one of the sites i think it was from ehowcombr br the center for science in the public interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods including gerbers heinz earths best and beechnut according to the centers report earths best did not use starchy fillers or replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables earths best uses certified organic products the brand offers singleingredient smooth foods for infants over four months fruit vegetable grain and meat blends for babies over six months and a variety of chunky soups dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old earths best products are sold at supermarkets natural food stores and big box stores nationwidebr br plus my baby girl loves it  yes it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods but i just add a little rice with it and that fixes it
5390,5,we only use jarred baby food as emergency food  i make all my little ones food and freeze it or give it fresh  yes full time working mom but really is it that hard to cook puree and freeze basic foods like carrots that cost  for  pounds  i taste all the foods that my baby eats and enjoy the earths best line because they taste real  its not food that you could add to a baby shower game and go what in the world was that  they use quinoa and kamut flours  it is excellent all aroundbr br i believe that the apricot puree that others talked about in the sweet potato and chicken dinner is there to maintain the color of the food  i make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns brown  my baby doesnt care about the color of the food but im sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar  knowing how vibrant sweet potatoes arebr br half of the jars in my case were popped up  i wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars  i called and they replaced the entire case free of charge  this had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and didnt occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue  i was impressed with the speed and efficiency at which amazon handled this  will continue to be a loyal customer because of this  customer service goes a long ways
5391,5,we love the earths best line in our house our  mo old daughter  will only eat earths best dinners and i dont blame her the smell from both of the other  brand was nauseating ive sampled the earths best dinners myself and they arent half bad it is baby food the fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well
5392,4,organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life that is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your childs developing brain and body is a very worthy goalbr br fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up with our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go etc also no matter how worthy a goal your child has to eat the food this is an excellent combination of flavors that i was not always able to find at local stores and with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my doorbr br the flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as water organic carrots organic apples organic ground turkey organic whole barley flourbr br sweet potato and chicken water organic sweet potatoes organic apricot puree mechanically separated organic chicken organic brown rice flourbr br summer vegetable water organic corn organic zucchini organic green beans organic brown rice organic carrots organic garbanzo beans organic canola oilbr br rice and lentil water organic apples organic carrots organic brown rice organic lentils organic canola oilbr br there are other earth best blends where water is not the number one ingredient obviously that somewhat calls into the question the value of this particular earths best item i just found the tomato and carrot one which i have ordered but not received yet  also if you put in organic baby food in amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example peter rabbit organics have not yet tried it but might when she is a bit olderbr br overall though i do recommend this variety pack our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients and for a decent price even considering the amount of water in them the water being first in all  is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something i will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward the ingredient lists are all directly from the earth bests website earthsbestcom  as i do not have the products in front of my right now
5393,2,i agree with a previous reviewer  when it comes to the dinners just about all of the earths best choices they are watery and sweet  apples or some other fruit in just about everything and the first ingredient is nearly always water  ive decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase proteincontaining dinners from another jarred brand or mixing my own  id really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young agebr br the earths best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great  just check the label to make sure water isnt the first ingredient listed i just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up
5394,2,as i have with all other earths best jarred baby food i wont be purchasing these dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain bpa  i contacted earths bests consumer relations dept personally and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines earths best baby food jar lids contains trace amounts of bpa but it doesnt come into direct contact with the food  that kind of lukewarm response wasnt enough to put my concerns about bpa to rest  after all packaged food is jostledaround so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down with the food resting directly on the jar lids  so i guess ill have to pass on these jarred dinners for now  the earths best rep did say that they were doing accelerated testing of bpafree alternatives for lining their baby food jarsbr br this is such a shame because earths best is the only company that makes organic prepackaged stage  complete meals eg with meatprotein veggies  carbsstarch in puree form  all the other organic baby food manufacturers such as plum sprout ellas kitchen etc only make stage  meals in chunky form  earths best does make some baby food in bpafree squeeze pouches but that doesnt include its dinner line  i was hoping to be able to expose my littleone to a wider variety of flavors and wellbalanced meals while still at the puree stage  but i guess ill have to wait until shes old enough for stage  chunky meals or make her baby food myself  virtually impossible for this superbusy and domesticallychallenged mom lol
5395,1,i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid like water i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter amazon customer service however was awesome and gave me a full refund
5396,1,bought this after reading the good reviews  not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold i actually opened two containers to make sure it wasnt just my nose playing tricks on me i love this brand and i am very disappointed
5397,4,my daughter loves these dinners theres no other organic meat option at my grocery store so were stuck with this one but i dont mind at all i think theyre great i agree that they are runny but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal and problem solved turkey dinner is thick enough  i also dont understand why people complain that they are too sweet or unhealthy first of all if you dont like the ingredients buy something else second i trust earths best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product third the belief that if baby tastes sweet food they will not eat regular food is an old wifes tale are you people saying that you dont give your babies fruit and vegetables they are all sweetbr the only reason i gave this particular item  stars instead of five is the price i can buy it at my grocery store for  cents a jar here they are being sold for over  cents and thats at the sale price if you buy these at the regular price it comes to  way too much
5398,5,id continue to buy but im moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too
5399,4,i love the thought that these baby foods are organic  the shipping is quick well packaged and easy to open  baby likes all flavors so far of any type of earths best baby food  however this brand is always more watery than any other brand ive tried
5400,5,our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack  we make most of our own baby food but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult  since packing space was limited we had this shipped to our destination  it was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack  the kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good
5401,5,my monthold is a fanatic for these flavors  she gobbles them up and we cant load the spoon fast enough for her  we introduce new foods every  days and we always get the interesting blends as well so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her  she goes mmm mmm lol  its so cute and meats are an easiertoabsorb source of iron compared to artificiallyenriched iron that is found in baby cereals  i definitely prefer this as a compliment to mommys milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest
5402,4,i actually cook most of my twins savory meals but i always keep a package of these eb dinners on hand  for  feeding the girls on the go and  for those times when i just dont have the energy to cook or defrost whatever is in the freezer the girls like most of the flavors except for the peas i wish eb had more variety packages with different flavor available
5403,3,to be honest my baby didnt really love all of these at first hes pretty picky so i had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them  he took to the gourmet meals pack right away but didnt love all of these  but as hes gotten older hes gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit  the prices on amazon are good so i will continue to order these here
5404,5,my one year old loves this product she eats one every day and never gives me a problem and i trust the ingredients which reassures me that shes eating something thats good for her
5405,2,amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and ontime but i guess this is one product that they can notbr br several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out  i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item well need to go to the grocery store for
5406,5,i like the variety in this packnice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all the only thing i would suggest is if you have a picky eater maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box
5407,4,i purchased this food on amazon then saw it at babies r us for  cents less per jar  i like the product but amazon is overcharging
5408,4,my baby has been eating this brand since he was  months i like the convenience of high qualityyet not overly pricey jar food like this it is easy on his stomach never had any health issues with it the dinners are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up summer vegetable is his least favorite the zucchini like cucumber smells pretty strong he would eat it now but when we first started he hated it my son loves the other  flavors and thats why i continued with my subscription since its more expensive to buy them separately
5409,5,organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what i highly recommend earths best products he loves the formula foods and diapers i love the products because its best for my baby i wish i knew about organics and earths best  years ago with my first baby
5410,5,my baby loves these dinners they are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried i love the fact that they are organic and amazon sells them at such a great price
5411,4,my month old son is not the picky eater my first was he had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in  months and it was peascant blame him for that one but he refused to swallow the rice  lentil flavor in this variety pack he actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries cute but messy i tried several times over  weeks and got the same response each time we will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals
5412,3,i did like this product until some jars i found black mold on the inner lidsbr br i read other reviews but i thought it mustve been a bad batch  i was wrongbr br earths best used to be very good so i canceled my next subscribe and save order  then i feedback cancel reason to amazon
5413,5,i used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughters diet  she loves all four of the varieties
5414,5,this is a nice variety of flavorstwo are meatbased chicken and turkey and two are vegetablebased summer veggie and ricelentil  my monthold daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors  ive had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods so im happy to have found two meat meals that she loves  as with other earths best varieties these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives
5415,5,great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item and i love that it automatically comes to me  these are great and they taste really good making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child
5416,5,i love earths best my son eats almost all of the earths best single and combination foods this pack in particular has two of his dinnerlunch favorites summer vegetable and brown rice and lentil some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken
5417,5,my son loves earths best baby food he enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits he has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up
5418,4,my son really enjoys all these flavors eats them all fast shipping no shopping in stores great prices would recommend to all
5419,3,love earths best but my  mth old daughter only liked one of the  selections i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk walmart usually has them for  each
5420,2,i was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews i wasnt really impressed when my son tried the food the consistency was way too thin and my son would hardly eat the whole jar i would recommend making your own baby food or use the gerber organic
5421,3,our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby unfortunately two of the four varieties dont include meat i dont think summer vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack thats what the vegetable variety pack is for also the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby
5422,3, of the flavors are pretty good but the sweet potato  chicken is pretty gross i was wondering why my daughter didnt want to eat it until i tried it myself
5423,2,my baby didnt seem into these dinners so i tried them theyre not terrible but not good either well stick with the eb fruits and veggies until shes ready for table foods
5424,4,this is great  organic baby food options  delivered to my doorstep  the dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table
5425,5,my little guy loves to try new foodsso this variety pack is greatbr br feeding organic is the way to go we trust and love the earths best brandbr ther formula is great amazoncom seems to have the best price around i checkedbr br it is great to get the auto ships of babyfoodless trips to the store for dad 
5426,2,we ordered the earths best nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack  we got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack not the dinner pack  found out we cant return the item either  we will try the amazon phone help but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff
5427,1,my baby loves this food  at whole foods they sell the same flat for  and thats retail  i ordered this and just received it today  i hadnt even opened package and i could smell a rotten smell coming from box i opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere im so disgusted and cant believe i waited over a week for this to arrive  what a waste of my time  the worst part is i ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere  i dont get how this happens the  shipping box isnt dented or damaged neither is the flat box  so what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment not a happy customer
5428,1,dont let the earths best name fool you  as stated in multiple reviews here  check the ingredients  no wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme my kids will only eat earths best  well thats because they are all sweetened which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly  they will develop a sweet tooth quickly and will start rejecting pure vegetables  other good things because of this  there is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods  thats just shameful and there is only one reason for it  so the child will eat it and only want this brandbr br best advice  if you must buy premade food be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredients and if needed water  thats it  dont buy a vegetable that has applesauce or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because its sweetenedbr br shame on earths best as a company  kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think its a great product based solely on the name
5429,5,i found this tea when i explored a local grocery store on the north shore of oahu on a trip to hawaii last summer every now  then i like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea wasnt totally bizarre how youd guess im american i enjoy white black flavored  herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blendsbr br i didnt know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea nondairy creamer rosehip extract  refined sugar ive never considered putting nondairy creamer into tea would it be a mess i dumped into the mug  stirred to death instead i found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foillike moisture proof packagebr br after steeping mins i was thrilled to discover a lightflavored cup of tea slightly fruityscented with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste and no stirring no clump at the bottom of the cupbr br a year later i found one of the packages in my luggage  found it just as tasty  easy to prepare as last year i went online to buy some more  was thrilled to find that amazon offered the same item  a couple of other flavors by the same company too
5430,5,these are probably the best crackers ive ever tasted  they came in a christmas gift basket but i liked them so much that i had to google them to see how to get more  this variety contains oregano poppyseed and garlic powder  because of how thin they are theres nowhere for the flavor to hide  try them with smoked provolone  i highly recommend them
5431,1,google propylene glycol to find out why  i bought this product along with several others without running the ingredients by my wife first a nurse of  years shebr was surprised when she noticed it we went a googling and poured my  order down the drain afterwards  theres pure and then theres not so muchbr br from the website  br br propylene glycolbr br a cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze in the skin and hair propylene glycol works as a humescent which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water the material safety data sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damagebr also used inbr br   tyre sealantbr   rubber cleanerbr   deicerbr   stain removersbr   fabric softenerbr   degreaserbr   paintbr   adhesivebr   wallpaper stripperbr br i wrote the company about this concern and they never responded
5432,5,we love grilling all year long but can not get this in markets the price is great and they ship fast now i can get them year round with no salt
5433,5,since being diagnosed with high blood pressure this product has been a staple in our home i especially enjoy the grilling blends for the price i got it for online it was a great deak usually much more expensive in store so buying in bulk from amazon is the way to go
5434,1,received  bottles of concentrate from paragon mixed exactly to their specs and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavorsbr br i am truly saddened to have to encourage you to not purchase the watermelon flavorbr br this item has be returned for a refund
5435,4, ground arabica beans not my favorite but not bad for a lightmedium brewsmells wonderful as its flowing out of the kaldi machine smooth and not bitter slight floral aftertaste
5436,5,i purchased some of this special habanero sauce this past year for my super bowl party it was a hit i thought i would try the mild since i like some zing but didnt want to burn my mouth off it was a great mix of some spicy zing with a sweet overtone went great with chips as a dip as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wingsbr br i am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork tenderloin i think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores plus it is from a small businesswin win winbr br thanks again everidae sauce for a great change of pace
5437,5,mild everidae sauce is like a condiment it goes on everything and doesnt take over the flavor of the food but enhances it i use this sauce on burgers shredded pork grilled chicken baked chicken eggs as a pizza sauce substitute and basically anything my kids love the mild kick and flavorful enhancement of the mild sauce my  and  year old put it on everything and rave it will change your cooking and challenge you to try it on everything
5438,5,so i have sampled and bought my fair share of everidae sauce and i have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food  i will start off by saying i do know the maker of this sauce and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everythingbr br i like spicy hotness and unlike other condiments like franks red hot this doesnt mask the flavor of the food but adds to itbr i have used this sauce on hotdogs hamburgers chicken tacos and eggsbr br the mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hotthe hot being the heat that i particularly enjoy  but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water
5439,5,i have been a huge fan of jelly bellys since i was a kid which was about  years ago  i have always had a favorite  at first it was peach then banana  juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years  i thought nothing would top it ever  then i tried red apple  it is sweet and tart and really delicious my new favorite flavor  a ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and i am sorry they are currently all sold out
5440,5,i wasnt sure what to expect from this jelly belly flavor i have eaten red apples before but they were usually in a fruit this was a candied bean with red apple flavors put inside despite the obvious witchcrafts i tried this confection because i am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the religious right wrong i was surprised to find that this red apple had a delicious applelike flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak would i eat more of these yes i would i would also recommend this red apple to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process red apple jelly beans they do taste like apples kind of but not completely still pretty good
5441,5,this jelly tastes heavenly you wont find anything this good at the grocery store all i can say is ill be ordering more shortly
5442,4,latest updatebr br we are now past the baby food stage so i may have missed this if it was formally announced but i recently heard that they switched packaging in late  to be completely bpa free  i confirmed this with customer service  leaving the remaining review as it wasbr br br br my wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months  then when our daughter was going to begin daycare there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought earths best  it was organic and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself  the variety packs are a nice easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors though some she hated as well  all in all we were pleased and baby seemed pleasedbr br needless to say i was pretty surprised to read the review about bpa in the lids  i spent some time trying to verify this myself  a lot of different blogs stated it and while i couldnt find anything definitive heres what bothered me  clearly earths best knows people are concerned about bpa in their lids  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question  the admin answers these the same way food safety and baby health is of the highest priority call us to discuss  thats only slightly paraphrased  going to their website they have zero articles on bpa and none in the faqs section either  nothing  im not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased but i would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents concerns and tell parents  something  hey we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of bpa found in our food is x which is so low there are no health concerns  just say something  anything  do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your productbr br as i was taking the time to review their product i decided i would call them to give them a fair chance to explain  something i likely wouldnt have done if i wasnt writing a review  their office was closed  am  pm est  not the most convenient times for a working parent but i will attempt to follow up and update this accordinglybr br updated oldbr just spoke to someone from customer service  she says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is bpa free but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner that does contain bpa but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food  im sure not everyone will be okay with that answer but im ok with it  i still think it should be an answer thats readily available to consumers without calling them but i will say there was no hold time at least
5443,5,here is the response i got to my emailed question about bpa in the lids of their glass jarsbr br while all of our earths best foods were and are safe earths best organicâ® jarred baby food was converted to packaging that does not use bpa in october br br that satisfies my concerns they include a  number if people have further questions please feel free to contact us at  monday through friday from am  pm mountain timebr br i dont know why they dont advertise this on the packaging website etc it would reassure a lot of parents
5444,5,i have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food the pack contains three each of pears peaches oatmeal banana apples and apricots and peaches bananas and raspberries my   month old daughter loves all of them especially the peaches bananas and raspberries i have been very satisfied with earths best with one exception the metal lids have a lining that contains bpa as do all lids on glass babyfood jars so if youre set on staying away from bpa youll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches like happybaby and plum organics i make a lot of my own babyfood so i feel that feeding her some food from glass jars is acceptable especially for varieties that i cant make i do also buy a lot of happybaby and im very satisfied with the quality there also all in all though a very nice variety of good tasting fruits
5445,4,awesome baby food i bought it online to save a few bucks but some of the jars were broken when they arrived  stars for the food  star for packing and shipping quality
5446,5,my little guy ate this all up before i could even write a review  
5447,1,i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earths best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains bpa br i thought i was avoiding the whole bpa issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers if its in the lids its going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging shipping storage etc i was planning on being a devoted earths best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass but then i found out about the bpa as a note if bpa doesnt bother you most of earths best food is tasty
5448,1,packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten however amazoncom does not let me return it this is not right i have put the pic of the food on packaging review page buyers should all take a look at it
5449,4,earths best baby foodbr my favorite brand of baby food by far both my son who is now over  years old and my daughter now almost one have used a wide variety of foods from earths best i am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic andor locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth but i do not feel that all organic brands are equal ive tried many varieties including store brands and others only available through internet purchase and found that earths best is by far the best for your moneybr br fruit variety packbr normally i would say this is a great idea but i wasnt a fan of this particular variety my son would have been just fine with it but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos these are both things i think shell grown out of but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item i would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy but if they dont i would say buy it other than that i do think its a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally also the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it we ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it
5450,2,just off the phone with them aug and they said that yes they stopped putting bpa in the liners in oct of course there is old stock on the shelves so i asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old with bpa or the new without bpa and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid if it is all white then it is bpa free  if it is metallic or gold then its the old lids which did contain a bpa layer thought this might help some of you out there
5451,5,i love earths best products thats the only product i use for my baby my baby loves it and i never had any problem with it it organic which makes it all that much better
5452,5,id continue to buy but im moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too
5453,1,i ordered this because i really like this brand and i have never had any issue with them  my son usually like all the flavors  i ordered this and the pears were sourspoiled  the other flavors my son refused to eat i am sure there was something wrong with it  so i am not sure what happened but i will not be buying these online anymore
5454,5,i love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them this fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best overall a great product high quality ingredients and they dont taste half bad i of course had to try them if my boys loved them
5455,1,several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars jars are cheaper at walmart
5456,5,my  month old loves these he hardly swallows one bite before hes already opened his mouth for the next bite i make my own baby food when i have time but when i dont this is a great alternative
5457,4,this was a good buy the variety is still close enough so i didnt have to worry if baby will like the next one
5458,4,i am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible we used many of the earths best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them what i found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were i often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon  water is added to many if not most of the flavors i wondered if that was a necessity however plum ellas kitchen and happy baby brands also organic do not have water as an added ingredient we definitely used these but to be honest i prefered the other brands because i felt we were getting a better value considering we werent paying for water in those packages
5459,5,im not the one who eats these so i cant give the best review but my son gobbles them up so ill take that as a  star rating from him and i give it  stars since i know its organic and i dont have to worry about what hes eating  now if i were to review his vegetables i might have to deduct a star for him but thats just because he doesnt seem to care for peas much
5460,4,with the amazon mom discount this is cheaper than in stores unless theres a sale  it regularly goes on sale at kroger publix and other grocery stores for around  cents a jar  i wish there were other earths best fruit varieties available on amazon at this price  no problems with breakage during shipping for me but i found the packaging annoying  in general though i think earths best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what youre getting  organic nongmo baby food delivered to your door step  as a single mom in a rural community going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hasslebr br earths best is definitely better tasting and smelling than nonorganic foods like gerber  the textures are good but i had to stay on st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all nd foods made my son gag  i had a similar issue graduating from nd foods to rd foods  sprout baby food however is the best quality ive tried for freshness aroma and taste  it reminds me of pureed fresh produce  while ive seen it in winndixie for the same price as earths best its much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online  im going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it but ill probably always keep a few jars of earths best to get by in a pinch
5461,4,i love getting this case it actually saved me money by buying it this wayand my son loved the fruit varieties i felt good about giving him this because it is organic the price is also good for the product
5462,5,i bought this for my  month old grandson to try  he loves it  im so pleased that i am ordering it for my infant greatniece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift  this food is inexpensive convenient and organic  best of all    he likes it  im setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandsonbr correction  the product i ordered two weeks ago was  a case  now the cost is   thats quite a price hike  is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down
5463,5,we just started using these and my month old daughter really likes them ive tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations i love that they are organic my only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when i got mine in the mail one of the jars was broken and i had to clean the food off of the other bottles
5464,5,my one year old loves this product she eats one every day and never gives me a problem and i trust the ingredients which reassures me that shes eating something thats good for her
5465,5,i have a habit of trying everything myself before offering it to my lo with this product i am sure that i am providing my lo with good nutrition and good tastebr he simply loves it 
5466,5,its gift for my princessit tastes good and  baby love itpackaging is also very carefully so they arrived home safely
5467,5,our baby loves loves this food we actually mix a jar with  scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up earths best is the best
5468,5,great variety of fruits and my  month old loved them all we bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks
5469,5,my son can not get enough of these fruit purees  i can not think of a higher standard of praise for this product
5470,5,i was very pleased with the price of this product and the shipping speed was fast i like that i didnt have to lug this back from the grocery store thanks amazon
5471,5,the bananas are a little runnier than most brands but overall my son loves this stuff  and what a great price
5472,4,liked the baby foodyes for myself p really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treatexcept the peaches and apricots not soo much nice flavor and suchreally good though and timely shipping excellent buyer
5473,5,my baby loves earths best product  the food is tasty and doesnt cause her constipation problem  im happy that i can find the organic and affordable food for my baby
5474,5,we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at daycare  however storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips  the flavor is wonderful the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our  month old  she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to replicate them at home  we also keep these in the pantry as back up
5475,5,i am loving earths best brand overall  i set out with the goal of making all of our sons food  however when i returned to work full time the puree time was less  so my goto backup is earths best baby food  were on stage two now almost stage  and he loves them  i appreciate the no added sugars  preservatives and that its mostly organic  he loves the taste and combos  good stuff great product love it
5476,4,the flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too  i did not give it  stars because i thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage   that is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal  my little girl loves them
5477,5,great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item and i love that it automatically comes to me  these are great and they taste really good making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child
5478,5,we love earths best its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings you can also buy a vegetable variety pack gourmet meals or my favorite the seasonal good price on amazon too especially if you do subscribe and save
5479,5,i like this one better than all the other ones by earths best the variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them allbr br if i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings it is packaged well and again the variety helps
5480,5,the variety pack is the way to go when buying in bulk my month old daughter loves all of the flavors
5481,5,i bought this for my  year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands weve purchased but i got this one for  less  great buy
5482,1,beware of what you are being charged  it says that its  but drugstore is charing you  plus  in shipping ive found this to be true for several other items on this sitebr im not sure if this is a misprint  amazon doesnt seem to think its an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item  i disagree and think its amazons responisbility to get to the bottom of this
5483,5,my son happily eats all of the fruitveggie varieties of earths best unlike the organic baby products none of which he likes at allbr br be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs not the dinner packs as they have meat in them
5484,1,i just called up customer service and found that since october  all the jars are bpa free butthe jars manufactured before october are still available in the market usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed so the jars with bpa lining on the lids are still floating around in the market the consumers cannot tell the difference so what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is bpa free or not this is very very disappointing from earths best
5485,2,i usually feed earths best baby food to my grandson he has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food i have given him this is the first time i have tried this particular variety pack i fed him the peach oatmeal banana and apples and apricots for breakfast this morning shortly after i noticed he was scratching i looked and he had a rash i remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so i checked and yes it is this variety pack i dont know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction unfortunately i fed him two different jars so i dont know which one caused it but i dont want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go just thought i would let others know
5486,5,i was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organicbr and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list so dahhit dawnsbr on me what have i been feeding my baby  we changed to earths bestbr i feel better feeding the bestbr also we use earths best formulawhen we changed our baby now sleepsbr thru the nightand that realy makes me happy 
5487,5,we are huge fans of earths best  my daughter loves them  its a great variety  i would definitely reccomend this

5489,2,amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and ontime but i guess this is one product that they can notbr br several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out  i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item well need to go to the grocery store for
5490,3,i like their variety package but also heard that there is bpa in the lid i will switch to other bpa free products
5491,1,there is bpa in the lids and company claims it doesnt touch the food so its okey why do they even write organic  times around the lid not honest to their costumer i wouldnt even give  star if l could
5492,1,i have a  month old who eats  food all of the time i bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste coincidentally as i was thinking that as i was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air  he couldnt breathe and i had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying  very scary and those jars went right in the garbage
5493,1,this food is phenomenal but way overpriced i pay  a case in new york city and it is often on sale for less than  a case at babiesrus in new york city grocery prices are obscene in ny so if i am paying less here this is no deal
5494,5,they have a bad tastei finish giving them away because my son started to cry everytime i tried to give thesei prefer beech nut or gerberyuck
5495,5,coriander is a spice many people pass up or simply overlook and very rarely use except when they might make a corned beef brisket every so often sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but its usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice the frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust full very rounded and wellbalanced  and very palatable mouth watering flavor with hints of lemon not extremely overpowering of all of your other flavors in whatever your making either which is very nice because this allows you to use it liberally if wanted it goes good on meats and vegetables and also smells great when you throw a handful in the bbq smoker and let the coriander smoke do its job on the meat and veggies on the bbq the frontier coriander powder is of exceptional value and quality if you like coriander and think youd like to start experimenting with it in your recipes id recommend buying some and rediscover the world of delicious coriander
5496,5,coriander is my favorite spice after cumin and i go through loads of it i put it in practically everything i cook the only problem is its so freaking expensive if you buy it in a grocery store you need to pay  bucks for a dinky little container so i shopped around a bit online until i found this and its the best deal i could come up withbr br i mean two whole pounds of coriander for under  bucks it sounds too good to be true however the price was too low to resist and i figured that even if it was poor quality i could just use a double or triple amount because two poundsbr br anyways the coriander itself comes in two pound metallic bags so far ive only opened one and the other is chilling in my freezer the coriander is fragrant and flavorful even better than i expected the only danger is that i might overspice as i eagerly throw handfuls of the stuff into everything i make why because i have two pounds if i ever run out i will definitely consider buying this againbr br the only real con is that there is so much coriander that it might take too long to use and lose flavor over time i honestly dont think that will be a problem for me considering how much i use but it might be smart to split the order among multiple people for this price you really cant go wrong
5497,5,after coming back from living in england for several months i craved me some coriander carrot  coriander soup corianderspiced omelettes  but even in the bay area this spice been surprisingly hard to find especially at a decent pricebr br buying it in bulk from this seller the price is unbeatable and the quality seems comparable to the namebrand topnotch stuff in england  one thing to note is that the coriander comes in metallic pouches not resealable so if you want to keep it in a resealable bagcontainer youll have to provide your ownbr br also i wish i had found someone to split this with me since it seems like even  bag will last me forever
5498,5,unless you can use it all plan on sharing great ingredient for my southwest spice mix recipes and any dish you might want to spice up
5499,5,the quality of these spices is excellent and rather than buying smaller amounts at huge comparative cost and inferior in quality at a supermarket this is really the way to go i store unopened packages in the freezer for freshness along with cardamom this is a spice i use daily so i appreciate the deal here
5500,5,happy with this purchase its a good deal its the most fragrant coriander ever coriander is a super spice tridosha and a health supplement as well research it its a ground cilantro seed we use it in lots of dishesbr thank you
